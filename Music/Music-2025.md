## My Prerogative 

People can take everything away from you

But they can never take away your truth

But the question is

Can you handle mine?

That's my prerogative

They say I'm nasty, but I don't give a damn

Gettin' boys is how I live

Some ask me questions, why am I so real?

But they don't understand me

I really don't know the deal about my sister

Tryin' hard to make it right

Not long ago, before I won this fight

Everybody's talkin' all this stuff about me

Why don't they just let me live? (Tell me why)

I don't need permission, make my own decisions (Oh!)

That's my prerogative (That's my prerogative)

It's my prerogative

It's the way that I wanna live (It's my prerogative)

You can’t tell me what to do

Don't get me wrong, I'm really not souped

Ego trips is not my thing

All these strange relationships really gets me down

I see nothing wrong spreadin' myself around

You can’t tell me what to do

Why can't I live my life

Without all of the things that people say?

Oh, oh

I'm addicted to you

Don't you know that you're toxic?

And I love what you do

Ooh, hey, yeah

Hush, just stop

There's nothing you can do or say (Baby)

I've had enough

I'm not your property as from today (Baby)

You might think that I won't make it

On my own

But now I'm stronger than yesterday

Now it’s nothing but my way

My loneliness ain't killing me no more

I, I'm stronger

Than I ever thought that I could be (Baby)

I used to go with the flow

Didn't really care 'bout me

My loneliness ain't killing me no more (No more)

(I'm) I, I'm stronger

## Everytime 

Notice me

Take my hand

Why are we

Strangers when

Our love is strong?

Why carry on without me?

Every time I try to fly, I fall

Without my wings, I feel so small

I guess I need you, baby

And every time I see you in my dreams

I see your face, it's haunting me

I guess I need you, baby

I make believe

That you are here

It's the only way

I see clear

What have I done?

You seem to move on easy

And every time I try to fly, I fall

Without my wings, I feel so small

I guess I need you, baby

And every time I see you in my dreams

I see your face, you're haunting me

I guess I need you, baby

I may have made it rain

Please forgive me

My weakness caused you pain

And this song's my sorry

Ooh

At night, I pray

That soon your face will fade away

And every time I try to fly, I fall

Without my wings, I feel so small

I guess I need you, baby

And every time I see you in my dreams

I see your face, you're haunting me

I guess I need you, baby

## Boys (The Co-Ed Remix) (Ft. Pharrell Williams) 

For whatever reason

I feel like I've been wanting you all my life

You don't understand?

I'm so glad we're at the same place at the same time

It's over now

I spotted you dancing, you made all the girls stare

Those lips and your brown eyes (ooh), and the sexy hair

I shake, shake my thang, make the world want you

Tell your boys you'll be back, I wanna see what you can do

What would it take for you to just leave with me?

Not tryna sound conceited

But you and me were meant to be

You're a sexy guy, I'm a nice girl

Let's turn this dance floor into our own little nasty world

Boys, sometimes a girl just needs one (you know I need you)

Boys, to love her and to hold (I just want you to touch me)

Boys, and when a girl is with one

Boys, then she's in control

Pull your girl off the dance floor, whisper in her ear

Must've said something about me (so, what you say?)

'Cause now she's looking over here

You looking at me, with that sexy attitude?

But the way your girl's moving it, it puts me in the mood (Ow)

Hey, yo, come on

What would it take for you to just leave with me? (Come on, girl)

Not tryna sound conceited, but meeting you was destiny (Don't you know?)

I'm from N.E.R.D. (Ooh)

Aren't you Britney? (Don't you know?)

Let's turn this dance floor into our own little nasty thing

(Get nasty!)

Girls, I can't speak for no one (I get nasty)

Girls, well, I need her all the time (I get nasty)

Girls, I don't know 'bout your girl (I get nasty)

Girls, but I know she's on to mine (you like that? Ooh)

Boys, sometimes a girl just needs one (I get nasty)

Boys, to love her and to hold (I get nasty)

Boys, and when a girl is with one (I get nasty)

Boys, then she's in control

You like that?

Here we go

Have no fear

Baby, what you waiting for?

Uh-uh

Let me see what you can do

Boys, sometimes a girl just needs one

Boys, to love her and to hold (the way that you move)

Boys, and when a girl is with one (It's gonna turn me on)

Boys, then she's in control (oh)

Girls, I can't speak for no one

Girls, well, I need her all the time (it's just me and you, baby)

Girls, I don't know 'bout your girl (hold me too tight)

Girls, but I know she's judging mine (get nasty)

Boys

Girls

Boys

Girls

Boys (can't live with 'em)

Girls

Boys (can't live without 'em)

Girls

Get nasty!

## Sometimes 

You tell me you're in love with me

Like you can't take your pretty eyes away from me

It's not that I don't wanna stay

But every time you come too close, I move away

I wanna believe in everything that you say

'Cause it sounds so good

But if you really want me, move slow

There's things about me you just have to know

Sometimes I run

Sometimes I hide

Sometimes I'm scared of you

But all I really want is to hold you tight

Treat you right

Be with you day and night

Baby, all I need is time

I don't wanna be so shy, uh-oh

Every time that I'm alone, I wonder why

Hope that you will wait for me

You'll see that you're the only one for me

I wanna believe in everything that you say

'Cause it sounds so good

But if you really want me, move slow

There's things about me you just have to know

Sometimes I run (Sometimes)

Sometimes I hide

Sometimes I'm scared of you

But all I really want is to hold you tight

Treat you right

Be with you day and night

All I really want is to hold you tight

Treat you right

Be with you day and night

Baby, all I need is time

I'll just hang around and you'll see

There's nowhere I'd rather be

If you love me, trust in me

The way that I trust in you

Ah, ooh, yeah

Sometimes I run (Sometimes)

Sometimes I hide

Sometimes I'm scared of you (Ooh, oh)

But all I really want is to hold you tight (Hold you tight)

Treat you right

Be with you day and night (Day and night, ooh, yeah)

Sometimes I run (Sometimes)

Sometimes I hide

Sometimes I'm scared of you (Ooh, oh)

But all I really want is to hold you tight

I'll treat you right

I'll be with you day and night (Day and night)

All I really want is to hold you tight

Be with you day and night

Sometimes I run (Sometimes)

Sometimes I hide

Sometimes I'm scared of you

But all I really want is to hold you tight

I'll treat you right

I'll be with you day and night

## Overprotected (The Darkchild Remix) 

I need time

Joy

I need space

Love, I need me

(Four, three, two, one)

Say hello to the girl that I am

You're gonna have to see through my perspective

I need to make mistakes just to learn who I am

And I don't wanna be so damn protected

There must be another way

'Cause I believe in taking chances

But who am I to say what a girl is to do?

God, I need some answers

What am I to do with my life? (You will find it out, don't worry)

How am I supposed to know what's right? (You just gotta do it your way)

I can't help the way I feel

But my life has been so overprotected

I'll tell 'em what I like, what I want, and what I don't

But every time I do, I stand corrected

Things that I've been told, I can't believe what I hear about the world

I realize I'm overprotected

There must be another way

'Cause I believe in taking chances

But who am I to say what a girl is to do?

God, I need some answers

What am I to do with my life? (You will find it out, don't worry)

How am I supposed to know what's right? (You just gotta do it your way)

I can't help the way I feel (Help the way I feel)

But my life has been so overprotected

I need time, love

I need space

I don't need nobody telling me just what I wanna

What I, what, what, what I'm gonna (I need) do about my destiny

I say no, no, nobody's telling me just what I wanna do, do

I'm so fed up with people telling me to be someone else but me

Hey, yeah

What am I to do with my life? (You will find it out, don't worry)

How am I supposed to know what's right? (You just gotta do it your way)

I can't help the way I feel (Feel)

But my life has been so overprotected

I don't need nobody telling me just what I wanna

What I, what, what, what I'm gonna

Do about my destiny

(I say no, no) Nobody's telling me just

What, what, what I wanna do, do

I'm so fed up with people telling me to be

Someone else but me

What am I to do with my life? (You will find it out, don't worry)

How am I supposed to know what's right? (You just gotta do it your way)

I can't help the way I feel (Help the way I feel)

But my life has been so overprotected

## Lucky 

This is a story about a girl named Lucky

Early morning, she wakes up

Knock, knock, knock on the door

It's time for makeup, perfect smile

It's you they're all waiting for

They go, "Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?"

And they say

"She's so lucky, she's a star"

But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking

"If there's nothing missing in my life

Then why do these tears come at night?"

Lost in an image, in a dream

But there's no one there to wake her up

And the world is spinning, and she keeps on winning

But tell me, what happens when it stops?

They go, "Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?"

And they say

"She's so lucky, she's a star"

But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking

"If there's nothing missing in my life

Then why do these tears come at night?"

"Best actress, and the winner is, Lucky!"

"I'm Roger Johnson for Pop News, standing outside the arena waiting for Lucky"

"Oh my God, here she comes!"

Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?

She is so lucky, but why does she cry?

If there is nothing missing in her life

Why do tears come at night?

And they say

"She's so lucky, she's a star"

But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking

"If there's nothing missing in my life

Then why do these tears come at night?"

"She's so lucky, she's a star"

But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking

"If there's nothing missing in my life

Then why do these tears come at night?"

I used to think I had the answers to everything

But now I know

That life doesn't always go my way, yeah

Feels like I'm caught in the middle

That's when I realized

I'm not a girl

Not yet a woman

All I need is time, a moment that is mine

While I'm in between

I wanna shop around

I've just begun, don't wanna settle down

So I can turn up the bass like

Somebody pass my guitar

So I can look like a star

And spend this cash like

What you gonna do when the crowd goes, "Ayo"?

Why you standing on the wall?

Music starting everywhere

So why don't you just move along?

All reason aside, I just can't deny, love the guy

Let's just do it, you and me

You and me

Or three

Or four, on the floor

One, two, three, not only you and me

Got one-eighty degrees, and I'm caught in between

Countin', one, two, three, Peter, Paul, and Mary

Getting down with 3P, everybody loves— (Oh)

Countin' one, two, three, not only you and me

Got one-eighty degrees, and I'm caught in between

Countin', one, two, three, Peter, Paul, and Mary

Getting down with 3P, everybody loves— (Oh)

## Make Me...

Friday

I'm dreaming a mile a minute 'bout somebody

This feeling, I wanna go with it, 'cause there's no way

We're hiding away from this tonight, oh, this tonight

No shame in the game, just cut the shit, be honest

Yeah, you know what you gotta do tonight, do tonight

Just want you to raise my roof

Something sensational (Sensational, oh, yeah)

And make me ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

And make me ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

No rules

From the bar to the car, let's take it back to my room

Ignite in the heat of the moment, let the sparks fuse

Blowin' up to the ceiling, we burnin' bright when we cut the light

'Cause you're the flame I can't do without

The fire comes in, the sky falls down

There's no way I'm gonna be fighting this tonight, this tonight

Just want you to raise my roof

Something sensational (Sensational, oh, yeah)

Baby, 'cause you're the spark that won't go out

My heart's on fire when you're around

Out in Vegas or a little bar

It's really not a difference if it's near or far

Listen, here we are, need you

I've always wanted what was off limits

Staring at you 'til I'm caught in this

Back and forth like this is all tennis

I'm all jealous, you came with someone

But we can tell that there are changes comin'

See, I can tell that you're a dangerous woman

That means you're speakin' my language, come on

Now follow me, let's go (Go)

Like Penelope in Blow (Blow)

Well aware that stealin' you is a felony, yeah, I know

That's why they keep on tellin' me to let go, yeah (Go)

All the way and I'm able

To give you something sensational, so let's go, yeah (Go)

## Touch of My Hand

I'm not ashamed of the things that I dream

I find myself flirting with the verge of obscene

Into the unknown, I will be bold

I'm going to places I can be out of control

And I don't want to explain tonight

All the things I've tried to hide

I shut myself out from the world so I

Can draw the blinds and I'll teach myself to fly

I love myself, it's not a sin

I can't control what's happening

'Cause I just discovered

Imagination's taking over

Another day without a lover

The more I come to understand

The touch of my hand

The small of my back, the arch of my feet

Lately I've been noticing the beautiful me

I'm all in my skin and I'm not gonna wait

I'm into myself in the most precious way

And I don't want to explain tonight

All the things I've tried to hide (To hide)

I shut myself out from the world so I

Can draw the blinds and I'll teach myself to fly

'Cause I just discovered

Imagination's taking over

Another day without a lover

The more I come to understand

The touch of my hand

There's a world undefined

In my body and mind

I won't be left behind

I'm already here

'Cause I just discovered

Imagination's taking over

Another day without a lover

The more I come to understand

The touch of my hand

'Cause I just discovered

Imagination's taking over

Another day without a lover

The more I come to understand

The touch of my hand

Hey, hey, hey, oh, oh (Oh, oh)

Hey, hey, hey, hey, oh, oh (Oh, oh)

Ayy, he-he-hey

Your voice is like music to my ears

Whisper softly and the world just disappears (World disappears)

## Unusual You

Nothing about you is typical

Nothing about you's predictable

You got me all twisted and confused

It's all new

Up 'til now, I thought I knew love

Nothing to lose and it's damage 'cause

Patterns will fall as quick as I do

But now

Bridges are burning, baby, I'm learning

A new way of thinking of

Love, I can see nothing will be just like it was

Is that because

Baby, you're so unusual?

Didn't anyone tell you you're supposed to

Break my heart? I expect you to

So why haven't you?

Maybe you're not even human 'cause

Only an angel could be so unusual

Sweet surprise I could get used to

Unusual you

(Ah, ah)

(Ah, ah)

Been so many things when I was someone else

Boxer in the ring, tryna defend myself

And the private eye to see what's going on

That's long gone

When I'm with you, I can just be myself

You're always where you say you will be

Shocking 'cause I never knew love like this

Could exist

Tables are turning, my heart is soaring

You'll never let me down

Answered my call, here after all

Never met anyone like you

Baby, you're so unusual

Didn't anyone tell you you're supposed to

Break my heart? I expect you to

So why haven't you?

Maybe you're not even human 'cause

Only an angel could be so unusual

Sweet surprise I could get used to

Unusual you

(Ah, ah)

(Ah, ah)

Can't believe that I almost didn't try

When you called my name

Now everything has changed

Baby, you're so unusual

Didn't anyone tell you you're supposed to

Break my heart? I expect you to

So why haven't you?

Maybe you're not even human 'cause

Only an angel could be so unusual

Sweet surprise I could get used to

Unusual you

(Ah, ah)

(Ah, ah)

## Phonography

We're not so different, you and me

'Cause we both share our share of obscenities

And everybody's got some freaky tendencies

Hidden or admitted 'cause we all got needs

And I make no apologies (Ah, ah)

I'm into phonography (Ah, ah)

And I like my bluetooth, buttons coming loose (Loose)

I need my hands free (Ah, ah)

Then I let my mind roam (Ah, ah)

Playing with my ringtone

He got service, I got service

Baby, we can talk all night (Go)

Let's talk about biology

Make believe you're next to me

Phonography, phonography

Talk that sexy talk to me

Better make sure that the line is clean

Keep it confidential, you and me

Phonography, phonography

Dirty talking, call it phonography (Hey)

I can follow all your commands

But there will be no talk of adding you to my plan

I'll keep you connected long as you understand

That's how we should keep it, Mr. Telephone Man

And I make no apologies (Ah, ah)

I'm into phonography (Ah, ah)

And I like my bluetooth, buttons coming loose (Loose)

I need my hands free (Ah, ah)

Keep it confidential, you and me

Phonography, phonography

Dirty talking, call it phonography (Hey)

Baby, if you're not alone, take me off speakerphone

What I'm 'bout to say right here's just for your ears to hear

If you need to hit me back, hit me back

I got a star 69 for that ass, for that ass (Go)

Let's talk about biology

Make believe you're next to me

Phonography, phonography

Talk that sexy talk to me

Keep it confidential, you and me

Phonography, phonography

Dirty talking, call it phonography (Hey)

## Lonely

To think I'm so naive

How dare you play with me?

I gave you heart and soul, yeah

Tell me baby, please

Why you screwing with my head?

I don't think you understand

I won't take your (huh) no more

Don't knock on my door

Not this time, because I recognize

I've heard it all before, and I

I think of all the time that I wasted

Think of all the times that I took you back

Ain't no way I'll be lonely

I don't wanna let you back in

Let's just face it

Better off alone and I won't turn back

You thought that I would be lonely

I don't wanna let you back in

Don't tell me how to feel

Or say that you're for real

My mind's made up, I'm cool without ya

You got no more appeal

Now this girl don't need no man

To say what she can do or what she can't

Now I live for me

Boy, does that make you weep?

Not this time, because I realize

I've heard it all before, and I

I think of all the time that I wasted

Think of all the times that I took you back

Ain't no way I'll be lonely

I don't wanna let you back in

Let's just face it

Better off alone and I won't turn back

You thought that I would be lonely

I don't wanna let you back in

Think of times you made me cry

You had me so confused

I'm tired of trying, I'll leave behind this

What's a girl to do?

I think of all the times you made me sick

I used to think I couldn't handle it

What you think, I'm just another chick?

Messed with Brit, boy, you must have tripped

What were you thinking when you lost my trust?

You had it all, now you're left with nothing

Ooh, baby, now I know you want my touch

And now you're lonely and you still want me

I think of all the time that I wasted

Think of all the times that I took you back

Ain't no way I'll be lonely

I don't wanna let you back in

Let's just face it

Better off alone and I won't turn back

You thought that I would be lonely

I don't wanna let you back in

Think of all the time that I wasted

Think of all the times that I took you back

Ain't no way I'll be lonely

I don't wanna let you back in

Let's just face it

Better off alone and I won't turn back

You thought that I would be lonely

I don't wanna let you back in

I used to be your girlfriend and I know I did it well

Oh yes, you know it's true

You'd call me Cinderella

All you had to do was yell, and I'd be there for you

Here I am, so try to forgive me

I don't believe in fairytales

Here we are with nothing but honesty

I've had enough, I'm not gonna stay

I'm sorry for running away like this

And I'm sorry, I've already made my wish

Aah, but Cinderella's got to go

From time to time, I tried to tell just what was on my mind

You'd tell me, "Not today"

"Come back, do that"

"Where's Cinderella at?"

Was all you had to say

Here I am, so try to forgive me

I don't believe in fairytales

Here we are with nothing but honesty

I've had enough, I'm not gonna stay

I'm sorry for running away like this

And I'm sorry, I've already made my wish

Aah, but Cinderella's got to go

I'm sorry, just trying to live my life

Don't worry, you're gonna be alright

But Cinderella's got to go

I used to say I want you

You cast me in your spell

I did everything you wanted me to

But now I shall break free from all your lies

I won't be blind, you see

My love, it can't be sacrificed

I won't return to thee

I'm so sorry, I've already made up my mind

I won't return to thee

I'm sorry to say, I'm running away now

Don't worry, you will be alright

I'm running away, I've made up my mind now

You're gonna have to let me go

I'm sorry for running away like this

And I'm sorry, I've already made my wish

Aah, but Cinderella's got to go

I'm sorry, just trying to live my life

Don't worry, you're gonna be alright

But Cinderella's got to go

## Let Me Be

You try to read me, you try to figure out

You try to breathe me, but you can't blow me out

You try to feel me, but I'm so out of touch

I won't be falling, you won't have to pick me up

Sorry if I sound confused, I don't feel the way you do

But I won't turn around, but I won't turn around

Think that I might back down, but I won't

Think that I might have doubts, but I don't

No insecurities

Won't you just let me, let me be?

Think that you know me now, but you don't

Think that I, I can't stand on my own

Ain't my philosophy

Won't you just let me, let me be?

Trust in my instincts, trust that I know what's right

These are the reasons that keep you up at night (At night)

Tell me, "Go slow, this is my flow"

'Cause you don't know, know what I know

Let me tell you how it feels

Baby, it's time that you've seen me for real

Sorry if I sound confused, I don't feel the way you do

But I won't turn around (Won't turn around)

But I won't turn around

Think that I might back down, but I won't

Think that I might have doubts, but I don't

No insecurities

Won't you just let me, let me be?

Think that you know me now, but you don't

Think that I, I can't stand on my own

Ain't my philosophy

Won't you just let me, let me be?

Trust that I know, this is my show

Letting you know, gotta go the way I go

Trust that I know, this is my show

Letting you know, gotta go the way I go

Think that I might back down, but I won't

Think that I might have doubts, but I don't

No insecurities

Won't you just let me, let me be?

Think that you know me now, but you don't

Think that I, I can't stand on my own

Ain't my philosophy (It ain't my philosophy, yeah)

Won't you just let me, let me be?

Think that I might back down, but I won't

Think that I might have doubts, but I don't

No insecurities (No insecurities)

Won't you just let me, let me be?

Think that you know me now, but you don't

Think that I, I can't stand on my own (Think I can't stand on my own)

Ain't my philosophy

Won't you just let me, let me be?

## Bombastic Love

I, I'm here to testify

That you're the only one I belong to

I don't know where to start, it turned into an art

Not to show the world that it was you

Who made me realize not to compromise

The fact that you and I should meet

(I know we're gonna get, know we're gonna get, get)

Bombastic love, so fantastic

Where I’m completely yours, and you are mine

And it's gonna be exactly like in a movie

When we fall in love for the first time

Don't know why I feel so insecure

I never understood what it's good for

I've gotta make sure that weakness won't stop me again

I can't sit and wait anymore

You made me realize not to compromise

The fact that you and I should meet

(I know we're gonna get, know we're gonna get, get)

Bombastic love, so fantastic

Where I’m completely yours, and you are mine

And it's gonna be exactly like in a movie

When we fall in love for the first time

It's gonna be bombastic love

Everything is gonna be alright

When I'm yours and you are mine

It's gonna be a fantastic love

When I wake up, everything is still the same

And you don't even know my name

I know it's gonna be

Bombastic love, so fantastic

Where I’m completely yours, and you are mine

And it's gonna be exactly like in a movie

When we fall in love for the first time

(I know we're gonna get, know we're gonna get, get)

Bombastic love, so fantastic (Bombastic love, ooh yeah)

Where I’m completely yours, and you are mine (And you are mine)

And it's gonna be exactly like in a movie (Exactly like in the movies, baby)

When we fall in love for the first time

## That’s Where You Take Me

Oh baby, oh baby

Oh baby, oh baby

The love that all believe, I never found inside of me

Built these walls up so high, needed my room to breathe

Oh baby, oh baby, you tear them down

Can't believe you've changed my mind

Oh baby, oh baby, I saw your smile

Stay with me a while

All things fall into place

My heart, it feels so safe

You are my melody

That's where you take me

With you, I get so high

Lost in the crystal sky

You are this melody

That's where you take me

I never fell before, how did you find my door?

The key to my soul, to you forever more

Oh baby, oh baby, you make me rise

And never did I once think twice

Oh baby, oh baby, you make me smile

Stay with me a while, oh

All things fall in to place

My heart, it feels so safe

You are my melody

That's where you take me (That's where you take me)

With you, I get so high (I get so high)

Lost in the crystal sky (Crystal sky)

You are this melody

That's where you take me

Afraid to let it all inside

Now I wanna hear you'll stay with me a while

Stay with me a while

La-la-la-la-la-la (La-la-la)

La-la-la-la-la-la (La-la-la)

La-la-la-la-la-la (La-la-la)

That's where you take me

All things fall in to place

My heart, it feels so safe

You are my melody (Oh, baby)

That's where you take me (Where you, where you take me)

With you, I get so high

Lost in the crystal sky

You are this melody (Oh, baby)

That's where you take me

All things fall in to place

My heart, it feels so safe

You are my melody

That's where you take me

With you, I get so high

Lost in the crystal sky

## When I Found You

I believe we all have one true love

Somewhere in this world, I do

When it seemed all my dreams were falling through

That's when I found you

I believe for every heart that whispers in the dark

There's a ray of light somewhere shining through

It was sink or swim when the tide came in

I found myself when I found you

I found the closest thing to heaven

Yes, in you, I found the deepest love I knew

Ooh-ooh, oh, I believe, yes, it's true

I found myself when I found you

Ooh, yeah

I believe (I believe) for every door (Every door)

That's closing

For every heartbreak there's hope for something new

From the ashes rise a glimpse of paradise

It still flickered in your eyes

When I found you

I found the closest thing to heaven

Yes, in you, I found the deepest love I knew

Ooh-ooh, oh, I believe, yes, it's true

I found myself when I found you

Ooh, yeah

How life unfolds, no one knows

I thought love was just a tingling of the skin

I felt so alone, all alone

More than you could ever know

You show deeper love, sweeter love, when I found you

I found the closest thing to Heaven

I found the deepest love I knew

When I found you

I found the closest thing to heaven

Yes, in you, I found the deepest love I knew

Ooh-ooh, oh, I believe, yes, it's true

I found myself when I found you

Ooh, yeah

## I Run Away

You took your love away too fast

Left no chance to say, "Look back"

And now I know the truth, it makes it easier

Maybe when time goes by, I’ll understand

Let’s pretend that I’ve moved on

And I'll tell myself that life goes on without you

Open my eyes, look deep inside

I run away, I run away, I run away

You threw it all away

So blind (So blind)

You pushed me far from you in your life

Now I know the tears won’t lead to loneliness

Maybe when time goes by, I’ll understand

Let’s pretend that I’ve moved on

And I'll tell myself that life goes on without you

Open my eyes, look deep inside

I run away, I run away, I run away, I run away

Let’s pretend that I’ve moved on

And I'll tell myself that life goes on without you

Open my eyes, look deep inside

I run away, I run away, I run away

Let’s pretend that I’ve moved on

And I'll tell myself that life goes on without you

Open my eyes, look deep inside

I run away, I run away

Let's pretend that I've moved on

And I'll tell myself that life goes on without you

## What It’s Like to Be Me

Do you know what it's like?

Come on, come on

Baby, tell me, do I

Look like the kinda girl that you wanna take home?

Wanna make me your own?

Do you even know what I like?

Just what I'm living for, what I adore?

Baby, take the time to realize

I'm not the kind to sacrifice the way I am

So, if you wanna be my man, baby

Walk a mile in my shoes

Do me right or I'm through

Can't you see that if you want to stay around (I'm telling you)

You've got to figure me out? Boy

Take your time or you lose

This is my game, my rules

And I can see, obviously

Baby, you don't know what it’s like to be me

Do you know what it’s like?

Do you know what it’s like?

Don't you get it twisted, boy, I want you too

But you got my heart to win before I let you in

And this deceives you, baby, I'm not the average lady

I need someone to love

Baby, take the time to realize

I'm not the kind to sacrifice the way I am

So, if you wanna be my man, baby

Walk a mile in my shoes

Do me right, or I'm through

Can't you see that if you want to stay around (I'm telling you)

You've got to figure me out? Boy

Take your time or you lose

This is my game, my rules

And I can see, obviously

Baby, you don't know what it’s like to be me

Baby, get to know me

Then you can show me that you love for me is true

And I'll give you everything that a girl could give

Don't you want to be my man? (Oh)

Walk a mile in my shoes

Do me right, or I'm through

Can't you see that if you want to stay around (I'm telling you)

You've got to figure me out? Boy (You've got to figure me out, baby)

Take your time or you lose

This is my game, my rules (This is my game)

And I can see, obviously

Baby, you don't know what it’s like (B-B-B-Breakdown)

Walk a mile in my shoes

Do me right, or I'm through (This is my game, baby)

Can't you see that if you want to stay around (Although I ain't playin', sugar)

You've got to figure me out? (You, you've got to figure me out)

Take your time or you lose (Yeah, yeah)

This is my game, my rules (Yeah, oh)

And I can see, obviously

Baby, you don't know what it’s like to be me

## Before the Goodbye

Laying here in your arms, and you hold me tight, tight

Trying not to watch the clock tick, ticking as the time goes by

And I know that you best be on your way

But I'm wishing I could make you stay, stay with me for a while

Though you're near, still I wanna make it clear

Love, I will always be around

You're leaving, I'm waiting, forgive me

I'm always missing you before the goodbye

I feel it already, forgive me

I'm always missing you before the goodbye

Kinda hard for me to let you know

Still don't let my feelings show how much I will miss in you

All the little things that make me weak

Your eyes and the way you speak, without you, baby, I'm not me

Though you're near, still I wanna make it clear

Love, I will always be around

You're leaving, I'm waiting, forgive me

I'm always missing you before the goodbye

I feel it already, forgive me

I'm always missing you before the goodbye

You're leaving, I'm waiting, forgive me

I'm always missing you before the goodbye

I feel it already, forgive me

I'm always missing you before the goodbye

You're leaving, I'm waiting, forgive me

I'm always missing you before the goodbye

I feel it already, forgive me

I'm always missing you before the goodbye

You're leaving, I'm waiting, forgive me

I'm always missing you before the goodbye

# One Direction

## Up all night

### What Makes You Beautiful 

You're insecure, don't know what for

You're turnin' heads when you walk through the door

Don't need makeup to cover up (Huh)

Bein' the way that you are is enough

Everyone else in the room can see it

Everyone else but you

Baby, you light up my world like nobody else

The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed

But when you smile at the ground, it ain't hard to tell

You don't know, oh-oh, you don't know you're beautiful

If only you saw what I can see

You'll understand why I want you so desperately

Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe

You don't know, oh-oh, you don't know you're beautiful, oh-oh

That's what makes you beautiful

So c-come on, you got it wrong

To prove I'm right, I put it in a song

I don't know why you're being shy

And turn away when I look into your eyes

Everyone else in the room can see it

Everyone else but you

Baby, you light up my world like nobody else ('Body else)

The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed

But when you smile at the ground, it ain't hard to tell

You don't know, oh-oh, you don't know you're beautiful (Oh)

If only you saw what I can see

You'll understand why I want you so desperately

Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe

You don't know, oh-oh, you don't know you're beautiful, oh-oh

That's what makes you beautiful

Na, na-na-na, na-na-na, na, na

Na, na-na-na, na-na

Na, na-na-na, na-na-na, na, na

Na, na-na-na, na-na

Baby, you light up my world like nobody else

The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed

But when you smile at the ground, it ain't hard to tell

(You don't know, oh-oh) You don't know you're beautiful

Baby, you light up my world like nobody else (Light up my world like nobody else)

The way that you flip your hair (C'mon) gets me overwhelmed

But when you smile at the ground (Smile at the ground), it ain't hard to tell

You don't know, oh-oh, you don't know you're beautiful (Oh, woah)

If only you saw what I can see

You'll understand why I want you so desperately (Desperately)

Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe

You don't know (Don't know), oh-oh, you don't know you're beautiful, oh-oh

You don't know you're beautiful, oh-oh

That's what makes you beautiful

### Gotta Be You 

Girl, I see it in your eyes, you're disappointed

'Cause I'm the foolish one that you anointed with your heart

I tore it apart

And girl, what a mess I made upon your innocence

And no woman in the world deserves this

But here I am, asking you for one more chance

Can we fall one more time?

Stop the tape and rewind

Oh, and if you walk away, I know I'll fade

'Cause there is nobody else

It's gotta be you, only you

It's got to be you, oh, only you

Hey

Now, girl, I hear it in your voice and how it trembles

When you speak to me, I don't resemble who I was

You've almost had enough

And your actions speak louder than words

And you're about to break from all you've heard

But don't be scared, I ain't goin' nowhere

I'll be here, by your side

No more fears, no more cryin'

But if you walk away, I know I'll fade

'Cause there is nobody else

It's gotta be you, only you

It's got to be you, oh, only you

Oh, girl, can we try one more, one more time?

One more, one more, can we try?

One more, one more time, I'll make it better

(One more, one more, can we try?

One more, one more, can we try?)

Can we try one more time and make it all better?

'Cause it's gotta be you

It's gotta be you

Oh, only you, only you

It's gotta be you, only you

It's got to be you, oh, only you

### One Thing 

I've tried playin' it cool

But when I'm lookin' at you

I can't ever be brave

'Cause you make my heart race

Shot me out of the sky

You're my kryptonite

You keep makin' me weak

Yeah, frozen and can't breathe

Something's gotta give now

'Cause I'm dyin' just to make you see

That I need you here with me now

'Cause you've got that one thing

So get out, get out, get out of my head

And fall into my arms instead

I don't, I don't, don't know what it is

But I need that one thing

And you've got that one thing

Now I'm climbing the walls

But you don't notice at all

That I'm goin' out of my mind

All day and all night

Something's gotta give now

'Cause I'm dyin' just to know your name

And I need you here with me now

'Cause you've got that one thing

So get out, get out, get out of my head

And fall into my arms instead

I don't, I don't, don't know what it is

But I need that one thing

So get out, get out, get out of my mind

And come on, come into my life

I don't, I don't, don't know what it is

But I need that one thing

And you've got that one thing

(Woah, woah, woah)

You've got that one thing

Get out, get out, get out of my head

And fall into my arms instead

So get out, get out, get out of my head (Get out, get out, get out of my head, yeah)

And fall into my arms instead (Instead)

I don't, I don't, don't know what it is

But I need that one thing (I need that one thing)

So get out, get out, get out of my mind (Out of my mind)

And come on, come into my life

I don't, I don't, don't know what it is

But I need that one thing

And you've got that one thing

### More Than This 

Ooh

I'm broken, do you hear me?

I'm blinded, 'cause you are everything I see

I'm dancing alone, I'm praying

That your heart will just turn around

And as I walk up to your door

My head turns to face the floor

'Cause I can't look you in the eyes and say

When he opens his arms and holds you close tonight

It just won't feel right

'Cause I can love you more than this, yeah

When he lays you down, I might just die inside

It just don't feel right

'Cause I can love you more than this

Can love you more than this

If I'm louder, would you see me?

Would you lay down in my arms and rescue me?

'Cause we are the same, you save me

But when you leave, it's gone again

And then I see you on the street

In his arms, I get weak

My body fails, I'm on my knees, praying

When he opens his arms and holds you close tonight

It just won't feel right

'Cause I can love you more than this, yeah

When he lays you down, I might just die inside

It just don't feel right

'Cause I can love you more than this

Yeah

I've never had the words to say

But now I'm asking you to stay

For a little while inside my arms (Ooh)

And as you close your eyes tonight (Ooh)

I pray that you will see the light (Ooh)

That's shining from the stars above

And I say

When he opens his arms and holds you close tonight

It just won't feel right

'Cause I can love you more than this, yeah

('Cause I can love you more than this, yeah)

When he lays you down, I might just die inside

It just don't feel right

'Cause I can love you more than this, yeah

When he opens his arms and holds you close tonight (Holds you close tonight)

It just won't feel right

'Cause I can love you more than this (Yeah), yeah

When he lays you down, I might just die inside (I'm broken)

It just don't feel right

'Cause I can love you more than this

Can love you more than this

### Up All Night 

It feels like we've been living in fast forward

Another moment passing by (Up, up, up all night)

The party's ending, but it's now or never

Nobody's going home tonight (Up, up, up all night)

People going all the way, yeah, all the way

I'm still wide awake

Up all night

### I Wish 

Na-na-na-na-na

Na-na-na-na-na

He takes your hand, I die a little

I watch your eyes and I'm in riddles

Why can't you look at me like that? (Na-na-na-na-na)

When you walk by, I try to say it

But then I freeze and never do it

My tongue gets tied, the words get trapped

I hear the beat of my heart getting louder

Whenever I'm near you

But I see you, with him, slow dancin'

Tearing me apart 'cause you don't see

Whenever you kiss him, I'm breakin'

Oh, how I wish that was me

Na-na-na-na-na

Na-na-na-na-na

He looks at you the way that I would

Does all the things I know that I could

If only time could just turn back

'Cause I got three little words

That I've always been dying to tell you

But I see you, with him, slow dancin'

Tearing me apart 'cause you don't see

Whenever you kiss him, I'm breakin'

Oh, how I wish that was me

With my hands on your waist

While we dance in the moonlight

I wish it was me that you'll call later on

'Cause you wanna say goodnight

'Cause I see you, with him, slow dancing

Tearing me apart 'cause you don't see

But I see you, with him, slow dancin'

Tearing me apart 'cause you don't see

Whenever you kiss him, I'm breakin'

Oh, how I wish, oh, how I wish

Oh, how I wish that was me

Oh, how I wish that was me

### Tell Me a Lie 

Can't ever get it right

No matter how hard I try, and I've tried

Well, I put up a good fight

But your words cut like knives and I'm tired

As you break my heart again this time

Tell me I'm a screwed up mess

That I never listen, listen

Tell me you don't want my kiss

That you need your distance, distance

Tell me anything, but don't you say

He's what you're missing, baby

If he's the reason that you're leaving me tonight

Spare me what you think and tell me a lie

Well, you're the charming type

That little twinkle in your eye gets me every time

And, well, there must've been a time

I was the reason for that smile, so keep in mind

As you take what's left of you and I

Tell me I'm a screwed up mess

That I never listen, listen

Tell me you don't want my kiss

That you need your distance, distance

Tell me anything, but don't you say

He's what you're missing, baby

If he's the reason that you're leaving me tonight

Spare me what you think and tell me a lie

Tell me a lie

Tell me a lie

Tell me a lie

Tell me I'm a screwed up mess

That I never listen, listen (Listen)

Tell me you don't want my kiss

That you need your distance, distance

Tell me anything, but don't you say

He's what you're missing, baby

If he's the reason that you're leaving me tonight (Me tonight)

Spare me what you think and tell me a lie

Tell me a lie

Tell me a lie

Tell me a lie

Tell me a lie

### Taken 

Now that you can't have me

You suddenly want me

Now that I'm with somebody else

You tell me you love me

I slept on your doorstep

Beggin' for one chance

Now that I finally moved on

You say that you missed me all along

Who do you think you are?

Who do you think I am?

You only love to see me breakin'

You only want me 'cause I'm taken

You don't really want my heart

No, you just like to know you can

Still be the one who gets it breakin'

You only want me when I'm taken

You're messin' with my head

Girl, that's what you do best

Sayin' there's nothing you won't do

To get me to say "Yes"

You're impossible to resist

But I wouldn't bet your heart on it

It's like I'm finally awake

And you're just a beautiful mistake

Who do you think you are?

Who do you think I am?

You only love to see me breakin'

You only want me 'cause I'm taken

You don't really want my heart

No, you just like to know you can

Still be the one who gets it breakin'

You only want me when I'm taken

Thank you for showing me who you are underneath, no

Thank you, I don't need another heartless misery

You think I'm doing this to make you jealous

And I know that you hate to hear this

But this is not about you anymore

Who do you think you are?

Who do you think I am?

You only love to see me breakin'

You only want me 'cause I'm taken

You don't really want my heart

No, you just like to know you can (No, you don't, no, you don't)

Still be the one who gets it breakin' (Breakin')

You only want me when I'm taken

Now that you can't have me

You suddenly want me

### I Want 

Give you this, give you that

Blow a kiss, take it back

If I look inside your brain

I would find lots of things

Clothes, shoes, diamond rings

Stuff that's driving me insane

You could be preoccupied

Different date every night

You just got to say the word

But you're not into them at all

You just want materials

I should know because I've heard the girls say

I want, I want, I want, but that's crazy

I want, I want, I want, and that's not me

I want, I want, I want to be loved by you

You've got everythin' you need

But you want accessories

Got to hold it in your hand

If I changed the world for you

I bet you wouldn't have a clue

Don't you know that I can't stand when girls say

I want, I want, I want, but that's crazy

I want, I want, I want, and that's not me

I want, I want, I want to be loved by you

Oh, and all the girls say

I want, I want, I want, but that's crazy

I want, I want, I want, and that's not me

I want, I want, I want to be loved by you

Be loved by you, I wanna

I'll stay true, I wanna

If you knew what you put me through

Would you want, you want, you want me to love you too?

I want, I want, I want, but that's crazy

I want, I want, I want, but that's not me

I want, I want, I wanna be loved by you

(Oh, and all the girls say)

I want, I want, I want, but that's crazy

I want, I want, I want, and that's not me

I want, I want, I want to be loved by you

I want, I want, I want and all the girls say

I want, I want, I want, *and that's crazy*

I want, I want, I want to be loved by you

### Everything About You 

You know I've always got your back, girl

So let me be the one you come running to, running to, ru-ru-runnin'

I see it's just a matter of fact, girl, you just call my name

I'll be coming through, coming through, I'll keep comin'

On the other side of the world, it don't matter

I'll be there in two, I'll be there in two, I'll be there in two

I still feel it every time, it's just something that you do

Now ask me why I want to

It's everything about you, you, you

Everything that you do, do, do

From the way that we touch, baby

To the way that you kiss on me

It's everything about you, you, you (It's everything about you)

The way you make it feel new, new, new

Like every party is just us two

And there's nothing I could point to

It's everything about you, you, you (Everything about you)

It's everything about you, you, you (Everything about you)

It's everything that you do, do, do (Everything about you)

It's everything about you

Yes, I like the way you smile with your eyes

Other guys see it, but don't realise that it's my-my lovin'

There's something about your laugh that it makes me want to have to

There's nothing funny so we laugh at no-no-nothing

Every minute's like the last, so let's just take it real slow

Forget about the clock that's tick-tick-tickin'

I still feel it every time, it's just something that you do

Now ask me why I want to

It's everything about you, you, you

Everything that you do, do, do

From the way that we touch, baby

To the way that you kiss on me (Kiss on me)

It's everything about you, you, you (It's everything about you)

The way you make it feel, new, new, new

Like every party is just us two

And there's nothing I could point to

It's everything about you, you, you (Everything about you)

It's everything about you, you, you (Everything about you)

It's everything that you do, do, do (Everything about you)

It's everything about you

And you have always been the only one I wanted

And I wanted you to know, without you, I can't face it

All we wanna have is fun, but they say that we're too young

Let them say what they want

It's everything about you, you, you

Everything that you do, do, do

From the way that we touch, baby (The way that we touch, baby)

To the way that you kiss on me

It's everything about you, you, you (It's everything about you)

Everything that you do, do, do

Like every party is just us two

And there's nothing I could point to

It's everything about you, you, you (Everything about you)

It's everything about you, you, you (Everything about you)

It's everything that you do, do, do (Everything about you)

It's everything about you

### Same Mistakes 

Circles, we're going in circles, dizzy's all it makes us

We know where it takes us, we've been before

Closer, maybe looking closer, there's more to discover

Find out what went wrong without blamin' each other

Think that we got more time

When we're falling behind

Gotta make up our minds

Or else we'll play, play, play all the same old games

And we wait, wait, wait for the end to change

And we take, take, take it for granted that we'll be the same

But we're making all the same mistakes

Wake up, we both need to wake up

Maybe if we face up to this, we can make it through this

Closer, maybe we'll be closer, stronger than we were before, yeah

Make this something more, yeah

Think that we got more time

When we're falling behind

Gotta make up our minds

Or else we'll play, play, play all the same old games

And we wait, wait, wait for the end to change

And we take, take, take it for granted that we'll be the same

But we're making all the same mistakes

Yeah, yeah, that's what crazy is

When it's broke and you say there's nothing to fix

And you pray, pray, pray that everything will be okay

While you're making all the same mistakes

Don't look back

But if we don't look back

We're only learning then

How to make all the same mis—

Same mistakes again

So we play, play, play all the same old games (The same mistakes)

And we wait, wait, wait for the end to change (When nothing's gonna change)

And we take, take, take it for granted that we'll be the same (But nothing's gonna be the same)

But we're making all the same mistakes

Yeah, yeah, that's what crazy is (Crazy is)

When it's broke and you say there's nothing to fix (There's nothing to fix)

And you pray, pray, pray that everything will be okay (Oh, oh; That everything will be okay)

While you're making all the same mistakes

### Save You Tonight

### Stole My Heart

Baby, I'll take you there, yeah

Oh, tell me, tell me, tell me how to turn your love on

You can get, get anything that you want

Looking so good from your head to your feet

### Little Things 

Your hand fits in mine like it's made just for me

But bear this in mind, it was meant to be

And I'm joinin' up the dots with the freckles on your cheeks

And it all makes sense to me

I know you've never loved the crinkles by your eyes when you smile

You've never loved your stomach or your thighs

The dimples in your back at the bottom of your spine

But I'll love them endlessly

I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth

But if I do, it's you, oh, it's you, they add up to

I'm in love with you and all these little things

You can't go to bed without a cup of tea

And maybe that's the reason that you talk in your sleep

And all those conversations are the secrets that I keep

Though it makes no sense to me

I know you've never loved the sound of your voice on tape

You never want to know how much you weigh

You still have to squeeze into your jeans

But you're perfect to me

I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth

But if it's true, it's you, it's you, they add up to

I'm in love with you and all these little things

You'll never love yourself half as much as I love you

And you'll never treat yourself right, darling, but I want you to

If I let you know, I'm here for you

Maybe you'll love yourself like I love you, oh

And I've just let these little things slip out of my mouth

'Cause it's you, oh, it's you, it's you, they add up to

And I'm in love with you and all these little things

I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth

But if it's true, it's you, it's you, they add up to

I'm in love with you and all your little things

### C'mon, C'mon 

C'mon, c'mon (Ooh)

The one that I came with

She had to go

But you look amazing

Standing alone

So, c'mon, c'mon

Move a little closer now

C'mon, c'mon

Ain't no way you're walking out

C'mon, c'mon

Show me what you're all about

Yeah, I've been watching you all night

There's something in your eyes

Saying, "C'mon, c'mon, and dance with me, baby"

Yeah, the music is so loud, I wanna be yours now

So c'mon, c'mon, and dance with me, baby

The one that I came with

Didn't know how to move (Oh-oh-oh-oh)

The way that you let your hair down

I can tell that you do

So, c'mon, c'mon

Move a little closer now

C'mon, c'mon

Ain't no way you're walking out

C'mon, c'mon

Show me what you're all about

Yeah, I've been watching you all night

There's something in your eyes

Saying, "C'mon, c'mon, and dance with me, baby"

Yeah, the music is so loud, I wanna be yours now

So c'mon, c'mon, and dance with me, baby

And every step I take, I feel it more and more

She's calling out, she's a lucky girl

My heart is racing, she's turning around

I reach for her hand and I say

Hey, I've been watching you all night

There's something in your eyes

Saying, "C'mon, c'mon, and dance with me, baby"

Yeah, the music is so loud, I wanna be yours now

So c'mon, c'mon, and dance with me, baby

Yeah, yeah

C'mon, c'mon (Ooh)

C'mon, c'mon (Ooh)

C'mon, c'mon, and dance with me, baby

### Last First Kiss 

Baby, I, I wanna know

What you think when you're alone

Is it me, yeah?

Are you thinking of me, yeah? Oh

We've been friends now for a while

Wanna know that when you smile

Are you thinking of me, yeah? Oh, oh

Girl, what would you do?

Would you wanna stay

I wanna be last, yeah

Baby, let me be your, let me be your last first kiss

I wanna be first, yeah

Wanna be the first to take it all the way like this

And if you only knew

I wanna be last, yeah

Baby, let me be your last

Your last first kiss

Baby, tell me what to change

I'm afraid you'll run away

If I tell you

What I've wanted to tell you, yeah

Maybe I just gotta wait

Maybe this is a mistake

I'm a fool, yeah

Baby, I'm just a fool, yeah, oh, oh

Girl, what would you do?

I wanna be last, yeah

Your last first kiss (Your last first kiss), oh

I wanna be last, yeah

Baby, let me be your last

Your last first kiss

### Heart Attack 

Baby, you got me sick, I don't know what I did

Need to take a break and figure it out, yeah

Got your voice in my head saying, "Let's just be friends"

Can't believe the words came outta your mouth, yeah

I'm tryna be okay, I'm tryna be alright

But seeing you with him just don't feel right

And I'm, like, (Ow!)

Never thought it'd hurt so bad, gettin' over you, ooh

And (Ow!)

'Cause you're all I ever wanted, thought you would be the one

### Rock Me 

Do you remember summer '09?

Wanna go back there every night

Just can't lie, was the best time of my life

Lyin' on the beach as the sun blew out

Playing this guitar by the fire too loud

Oh, my, my, they could never shut us down

I used to think that I was better alone

Why did I ever wanna let you go?

Under the moonlight as we stared at the sea

The words you whispered, I will always believe

I want you to rock me, rock me, rock me, yeah

I want you to rock me, rock me, rock me, yeah

I want you to hit the pedal, heavy metal, show me you care

I want you to rock me, rock me, rock me, yeah

Yeah, we were together, summer '09

Wanna roll back like pressing rewind

You were mine and we never said goodbye (Ay, ay)

I used to think that I was better alone (Was better alone)

Why did I ever wanna let you go? (Let you go)

Under the moonlight as we stared at the sea (Stared at the sea)

The words you whispered I will always believe

I want you to rock me, rock me, rock me, yeah

I want you to rock me, rock me, rock me, yeah

I want you to hit the pedal, heavy metal, show me you care

I want you to rock me, rock me, rock me, yeah (Rock me, yeah)

### Change My Mind 

The end of the night, we should say goodbye

But we carry on while everyone's gone

Never felt like this before, are we friends or are we more?

As I'm walking towards the door, I'm not sure

But, baby, if you say you want me to stay, I'll change my mind

'Cause I don't wanna know I'm walkin' away if you'll be mine

Won't go, won't go

So, baby, if you say you want me to stay, stay for the night

I'll change my mind

Lean in when you laugh, we take photographs

There's no music on, but we dance along

Never felt like this before, are we friends or are we more?

As I'm walking towards the door, I'm not sure

But, baby, if you say you want me to stay, I'll change my mind

'Cause I don't wanna know I'm walkin' away if you'll be mine

Won't go, won't go

So, baby, if you say you want me to stay, stay for the night

I'll change my mind

I'll change my mind

But, baby, if you say you want me to stay, I'll change my mind

But, baby, if you say you want me to stay, I'll change my mind

'Cause I don't wanna know I'm walkin' away if you'll be mine

Won't go, won't go

So, baby, if you say you want me to stay, stay for the night

I'll change my mind

### I Would 

Lately, I found myself thinking

Been dreaming about you a lot

And up in my head, I'm your boyfriend

But that's one thing you've already got

He drives to school every morning

While I walk alone in the rain

He'd kill me without any warning

If he took a look in my brain

Would he say he's in L-O-V-E?

Well, if it was me, then I would, I would

Would he hold you when you're feeling low?

Baby, you should know that I would, I would

Would he say he's in L-O-V-E?

Well, if it was me, then I would, I would

Would he hold you when you're feeling low?

Baby, you should know that I would

Back in my head, we were kissing

I thought things were going alright (Alright, alright, alright)

With a sign on my back saying "Kick me"

Reality ruined my life (Go Tommo, go!)

Feels like I'm constantly playing

A game that I'm destined to lose

'Cause I can't compete with your boyfriend

He's got twenty-seven tattoos

Would he say he's in L-O-V-E?

Well, if it was me, then I would, I would

Would he hold you when you're feeling low?

Baby, you should know that I would, I would

Would he say he's in L-O-V-E?

Well, if it was me, then I would, I would

Would he hold you when you're feeling low?

Baby, you should know that I would

I would, I would

Would he please you?

Would he kiss you?

Would he treat you like I would? (I would)

Would he touch you?

Would he need you?

Would he love you like I would?

Would he say he's in L-O-V-E?

Well, if it was me, then I would

Would he hold you when you're feeling low?

Baby, you should know that I would

Would he please you? (Would he please you?)

Would he kiss you? (Would he kiss you?)

Would he treat you like I would? (Like I would)

Would he touch you? (Would he touch you?)

Would he need you? (Would he need you?)

Would he love you like I would? (Like I would)

Would he say he's in L-O-V-E?

Well, if it was me then I would, I would (Like I would)

Would he hold you when you're feeling low?

Baby, you should know that I would

I would (Yeah), I would (Yeah)

### Over Again 

Said I'd never leave her, 'cause her hands fit like my T-shirt

Tongue tied over three words, cursed

Running over thoughts that make my feet hurt

Bodies intertwined with her lips

Now she's feeling so low since she went solo

Hole in the middle of my heart like a Polo

And it's no joke to me

So can we do it all over again?

If you're pretending from the start

Like this, with a tight grip

Then my kiss can mend your broken heart

I might miss everything you said to me

And I could lend you broken parts

That might fit like this

And I will give you all my heart

So we can start it all over again

Can we take the same road? Two days in the same clothes?

And I know just what she'll say if I can make all this pain go

Can we stop this for a minute?

You know, I can tell that your heart isn't in it or with it

And tell me with your mind, body and spirit

I can make your tears fall down like the showers that are British

Whether we're together or apart, we can both remove the masks

And admit we regret it from the start

If you're pretending from the start

Like this, with a tight grip

Then my kiss can mend your broken heart

I might miss everything you said to me

And I could lend you broken parts

That might fit like this

And I will give you all my heart

So we can start it all over again

You'll never know how to make it on your own

And you'll never show weakness for letting go

I guess it's still hard if the seed's sown

But do you really want to be alone?

If you're pretending from the start

Like this, with a tight grip

Then my kiss can mend your broken heart

I might miss everything you said to me

And I could lend you broken parts

That might fit like this

And I will give you all my heart (All my heart)

So we can start it all o—

If you're pretending from the start (The start)

Like this, with a tight grip (Yeah)

Then my kiss can mend your broken heart (Can mend your broken heart, yeah)

I might miss everything you said to me

And I could lend you broken parts

That might fit like this

And I will give you all my heart

So we can start it all over again

### Back For You 

Whenever I close my eyes, I picture you there

I'm lookin' out at the crowd, you're everywhere

I'm watching you from the stage, yeah

Your smile is on every face now

But every time you wake up, you're hearing me say goodbye

Baby, you don't have to worry

I'll be coming back for you

Back for you, back for you, you

Lately, I've been going crazy

So I'm coming back for you

Back for you, back for you, you

I've never been so into somebody before

And every time we both touch, I only want more

So tell me nothing's gonna change, yeah

And you won't ever walk away, yeah

'Cause even though every night you'll know what I'll say, goodbye

Baby, you don't have to worry

I'll be coming back for you

Back for you, back for you, you

Lately, I've been going crazy

So I'm coming back for you

Back for you, back for you, you

Right back for you, oh-woah

Right back for you, right back for you

Lately, I've been going crazy

So I'm coming back

Yeah, I am coming back for you

Baby, you don't have to worry

I'll be coming back for you

Back for you, back for you, for you (For you, woah)

Lately, I've been going crazy (Crazy, yeah)

So I'm coming back for you

Back for you, back for you, you (Yeah)

Right back for you, right back

Right back for you, right back

Right back for you, right back

Right back for you (C'mon)

Lately, I've been going crazy

So I'm coming back for you

Back for you, back for you, you

### They Don’t Know About Us 

People say we shouldn't be together

We're too young to know about forever

But I say, "They don't know

What they talk, talk, talkin' about" (Talk, talk, talkin' about)

'Cause this love is only getting stronger

So I don't wanna wait any longer

I just wanna tell the world that you're mine, girl, oh

They don't know about the things we do

They don't know about the I love you's

But I bet you, if they only knew (They don't know)

They would just be jealous of us

They don't know about the up all nights

They don't know I've waited all my life

Just to find a love that feels this right (They don't know)

Baby, they don't know about, they don't know about us

Just one touch and I was a believer

Every kiss, it gets a little sweeter

It's getting better

Keeps getting better all the time, girl

They don't know about the things we do

They don't know about the I love you's

But I bet you, if they only knew (They don't know)

They would just be jealous of us

They don't know about the up all nights

They don't know I've waited all my life

Just to find a love that feels this right

Baby, they don't know about, they don't know about us

They don't know how special you are

They don't know what you've done to my heart

They can say anything they want

'Cause they don’t know us

They don't know what we do best

That's between me and you, our little secret

But I wanna tell 'em

I wanna tell the world that you're mine, girl

They don't know about the things we do (They don't know about the)

They don't know about the I love you's (I love you's)

But I bet you, if they only knew (If they only knew)

They would just be jealous of us (They would just be jealous of us)

They don't know about the up all nights

They don't know I've waited all my life (They don't know I've waited all my life)

Just to find a love that feels this right (It feels so right)

Baby, they don't know about (They don't know about us)

They don't know about the things we do (They don't know about us)

They don't know about the I love you's (They don't know about us)

But I bet you, if they only knew

They would just be jealous of us (They would just be jealous of us)

They don't know about the up all nights (Up all nights)

They don't know I've waited all my life (All my life)

Just to find a love that feels this right (Right)

Baby, they don't know about, they don't know about us

They don't know about us

### Summer Love 

Yeah

Ooh, ooh

Can't believe you're packing your bags

Trying so hard not to cry

Had the best time, and now it's the worst time

But we have to say goodbye

Don't promise that you're gonna write

Don't promise that you'll call

Just promise that you won't forget we had it all

'Cause you were mine for the summer

Now we know it's nearly over

Feels like snow in September

But I always will remember

You were my summer love

You always will be my summer love

Wish that we could be alone now

If we could find some place to hide

Make the last time just like the first time

Push a button and rewind

Don't say the word that's on your lips

Don't look at me that way

Just promise you'll remember when the sky is grey

'Cause you were mine for the summer

Now we know it's nearly over

Feels like snow in September

But I always will remember

You were my summer love

You always will be my summer love

So, please, don't make this any harder

We can't take this any further

And I know there's nothing that I wanna change, change

'Cause you were mine for the summer

Now we know it's nearly over

Feels like snow in September

But I always will remember (Will remember)

You were my summer love (Summer love)

You always will be my summer love (Summer love)

You always will be my summer love (*Yeah*)

You always will be my summer love

## Midnight Memories (The Ultimate Edition)

### Best Song Ever 

Maybe it's the way she walked (Ow!)

Straight into my heart and stole it

Through the doors and past the guards (Ow!)

Just like she already owned it

I said, "Can you give it back to me?"

She said, "Never in your wildest dreams"

And we danced all night to the best song ever

We knew every line, now I can't remember

How it goes, but I know that I won't forget her

'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever

I think it went, "Oh, oh, oh," I think it went, "Yeah, yeah, yeah"

I think it goes (Woo!)

Said her name was Georgia Rose (Ow!)

And her daddy was a dentist

Said I had a dirty mouth (I got a dirty mouth)

But she kissed me like she meant it

I said, "Can I take you home with me?"

She said, "Never in your wildest dreams"

And we danced all night to the best song ever

We knew every line, now I can't remember (How it goes, but I know)

How it goes, but I know that I won't forget her

'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever

I think it went, "Oh, oh, oh," I think it went, "Yeah, yeah, yeah"

I think it goes (Woo!)

You know, I know, you know I'll remember you

And I know, you know, I know you'll remember me

And you know, I know, you know I'll remember you (Oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)

And I know, you know, I hope you'll remember how we danced (Oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)

How we danced (Oh, oh, oh, one, two, one, two, three, ow!)

How we danced all night to the best song ever (How we danced)

We knew every line, now I can't remember (We knew every line)

How it goes, but I know that I won't forget her

'Cause we danced all night (We danced, we danced) to the best song ever (It goes something like this)

And we danced all night to the best song ever (Oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)

We knew every line, now I can't remember (Oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)

How it goes, but I know that I won't forget her (Oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I know that I won't forget her)

'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever (Oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, best song ever)

I think it went, "Oh, oh, oh," I think it went, "Yeah, yeah, yeah"

I think it goes (Woo!)

Best song ever

It was the best song ever

It was the best song ever

It was the best song ever

### Story of My Life 

Written in these walls are the stories that I can't explain

I leave my heart open, but it stays right here empty for days

She told me in the mornin' she don't feel the same about us in her bones

It seems to me that when I die, these words will be written on my stone

And I'll be gone, gone tonight (Oh-oh-oh)

The ground beneath my feet is open wide (Oh-oh-oh)

The way that I've been holding on too tight (Oh-oh-oh)

With nothing in between

The story of my life, I take her home

I drive all night to keep her warm

And time is frozen (The story of, the story of)

The story of my life, I give her hope

I spend her love until she's broke inside

The story of my life (The story of, the story of)

Written on these walls are the colors that I can't change

Leave my heart open, but it stays right here in its cage

I know that in the mornin', I'll see us in the light up on the hill

Although I am broken, my heart is untamed still

And I'll be gone, gone tonight (Oh-oh-oh)

The fire beneath my feet is burning bright (Oh-oh-oh)

The way that I've been holding on so tight (Oh-oh-oh)

With nothing in between

The story of my life, I take her home

I drive all night to keep her warm

And time is frozen (The story of, the story of)

The story of my life, I give her hope

I spend her love until she's broke inside

The story of my life (The story of, the story of)

And I've been waiting for this time to come around

But, baby, running after you is like chasin' the clouds

The story of my life, I take her home

I drive all night to keep her warm

And time is frozen

The story of my life, I give her hope (I give her hope)

I spend her love until she's broke inside ('Til she's broke inside)

The story of my life (The story of, the story of)

The story of my life

The story of my life (The story of, the story of)

The story of my life

### Diana 

Diana

The front pages are your pictures, they make you look so small

How could someone not miss you at all? (Oh-oh-oh)

I never would mistreat ya, no, I'm not a criminal

I speak a different language, but I still hear your call

Diana, let me be the one to

Light a fire inside those eyes

You've been lonely, you don't even know me

But I can feel you crying

Diana, let me be the one to

Lift your heart up and save your life

I don't think you even realise

Baby, you'd be saving mine

Oh-oh

Diana

It's only been four months, but you've fallen down so far

How could someone mislead you at all? (Oh-oh-oh)

I wanna reach out for ya, I wanna break these walls

I speak a different language, but I still hear you call

Diana, let me be the one to

Light a fire inside those eyes

You've been lonely, you don't even know me

But I can feel you crying

Diana, let me be the one to

Lift your heart up and save your life

I don't think you even realise

Baby, you'd be saving mine

We all need somethin'

This can't be over now

If I could hold ya

Swear I'd never put you down

Diana, let me be the one to

Light a fire inside those eyes

You've been lonely, you don't even know me

But I can feel you crying

Diana, let me be the one to

Lift your heart up and save your life

I don't think you even realise

Baby, you'd be saving mine

(Oh-oh-oh) Diana

(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh) Diana

Baby, you'd be savin' mine

(Oh-oh-oh) Diana

(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh) Diana

Baby, you'd be savin' mine

### Midnight Memories 

One, two, three, four

Straight off the plane to a new hotel

Just touched down, you could never tell

Ow, big house party with a crowded kitchen

People talk shh, but we don't listen

Tell me that I'm wrong, but I do what I please

Way too many people in the Addison Lee

Now I'm at the age when I know what I need, oh, woah

Midnight memories, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh

Baby, you and me stumblin' in the street

Singing, singing, singing, singing

Midnight memories, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh

Anywhere we go, never say no

Just do it, do it, do it, do it

Five foot somethin' with the skinny jeans

Don't look back, baby, follow me

I don't know where I'm going, but I'm findin' my way

Same old shh, but a different day

Tell me that I'm wrong, but I do what I please

Way too many people in the Addison Lee

Now I'm at the age when I know what I need, oh, woah

Midnight memories, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh

Baby, you and me stumblin' in the street

Singing, singing, singing, singing

Midnight memories, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh

Anywhere we go, never say no

Just do it, do it, do it

You and me and all our friends

I don't care how much we spend

Baby, this is what the night is for

I know nothing's making sense

For tonight, let's just pretend

I don't wanna stop, so give me more, 'ore, ow!

Midnight memories, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh

Baby, you and me (Me) stumblin' in the street (Street)

Singing, singing, singing, singing

Midnight memories, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh

Anywhere we go (Go), never say no (No)

Just do it, do it, do it, do it (Do it, do it, do it)

### You & I 

I figured it out

I figured it out from black and white

Seconds and hours

Maybe they had to take some time

I know how it goes

I know how it goes from wrong and right

Silence and sound

Did they ever hold each other tight like us?

Did they ever fight like us?

You and I

We don't wanna be like them

We can make it till the end

Nothing can come between you and I

Not even the gods above

Can separate the two of us

No, nothing can come between you and I

Oh, you and I

I figured it out

Saw the mistakes of up and down

Meet in the middle

There's always room for common ground

I see what it's like

I see what it's like for day and night

Never together

'Cause they see things in a different light like us

But they never tried like us

You and I

We don't wanna be like them

We can make it till the end

Nothing can come between you and I

Not even the gods above

Can separate the two of us

'Cause you and I

We don't wanna be like them

We can make it till the end

Nothing can come between you and I (Nothing can come between, yeah)

Not even the gods above

Can separate the two of us

No, nothing can come between you and I (You and I)

Oh, you and I (Oh)

You and I

We could make it if we try, you and I

Oh, you and I

You and I

### Don't Forget Where You Belong 

Been a lot of places, I've been all around the world

Seen a lot of faces, never knowing where I was

On the horizon, hmm, but I know, I know, I know, I know

The sun will be rising back home

Living out of cases, and packing up and taking off

Made a lot of changes, but not forgetting who I was

On the horizon, ooh, well, I know, I know, I know, I know

The moon will be rising back home

Don't forget where you belong, home

Don't forget where you belong, home

If you ever feel alone, don't

You were never on your own

And the proof is in this song

I've been away for ages, but I got everything I need

I'm flicking through the pages I've written in my memory

I feel like I'm dreaming, oh, so I know, I know, I know, I know

That I'm never leaving, no, I won't go

Don't forget where you belong, home

Don't forget where you belong, home

If you ever feel alone, don't

You were never on your own

And the proof is in this song

Lights off when they should be on

Even stars in the skies, they're wrong

Short days, when the nights are long

When I think of the things I've done

Don't matter how far I've gone

I'm always free to run home

Don't forget where you belong, home

Don't forget where you belong (Don't forget it), home

If you ever feel alone, don't

You were never on your own

Never, never, never, home

Don't forget where you belong, home

Don't forget where you belong (Don't forget it), home

If you ever feel alone, don't (Yeah)

You were never on your own (You were never)

And the proof is in this song

Home

Don't forget it

Home

If you ever feel alone, don't

You were never on your own (You were never)

And the proof is in this song

Never forget it, this song (Don't forget it)

No I'll never forget it, this song (You were never)

### Strong 

My hands, your hands, tied up like two ships

Drifting, weightless, waves try to break it

I'd do anything to save it

Why is it so hard to save it?

My heart, your heart, sit tight like bookends

Pages between us written with no end

So many words we're not saying

Don't wanna wait till it's gone

You make me strong

I'm sorry if I say I need you

But I don't care, I'm not scared of love

'Cause when I'm not with you, I'm weaker

Is that so wrong? Is it so wrong

That you make me strong?

Think of how much love that's been wasted

People always trying to escape it

Move on to stop their heart breaking

But there's nothing I'm running from

You make me strong

I'm sorry if I say I need you

But I don't care, I'm not scared of love

'Cause when I'm not with you, I'm weaker

Is that so wrong? Is it so wrong?

So, baby, hold on to my heart, oh

Need you to keep me from fallin' apart

I'll always hold on 'cause you make me strong

I'm sorry if I say I need you

But I don't care, I'm not scared of love

'Cause when I'm not with you, I'm weaker

Is that so wrong? Is it so wrong?

I'm sorry if I say I need you

But I don't care, I'm not scared of love

'Cause when I'm not with you, I'm weaker

Is that so wrong? Is it so wrong

That you make me strong?

I'm sorry if I say I need you

But I don't care, I'm not scared of love

'Cause when I'm not with you, I'm weaker

Is that so wrong? Is it so wrong

That you make me strong?

### Happily 

You don't understand, you don't understand (Yeah)

What you do to me when you hold his hand (Hey)

We were meant to be, but a twist of fate (Yeah)

Made it so we had to walk away (Hey)

'Cause we're on fire

We are on fire

We're on fire now

Yeah, we're on fire

We are on fire

We're on fire now

(One, two, three)

I don't care what people say when we're together

You know I wanna be the one

Who'll hold you when you sleep

I just want it to be you and I forever

I know you wanna leave, so c'mon

Baby, be with me so happily

(Hey) It's 4AM and I know that you're with him

(Yeah) I wonder if he knows that I touched your skin

(Hey) And if he feels my traces in your hair

(Yeah) I'm sorry, love, but I don't really care

'Cause we're on fire

We are on fire

We're on fire now

Yeah, we're on fire

We are on fire

We're on fire now

(One, two, three)

I don't care what people say when we're together

You know I wanna be the one

Who'll hold you when you sleep

I just want it to be you and I forever

I know you wanna leave, so c'mon

Baby, be with me so happily

So happily

One, two, three, four

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, we're on fire now

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, we're on fire now (We're on fire)

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, we're on fire now

I don't care what people say when we're together

You know I wanna be the one

Who'll hold you when you sleep

I just want it to be you and I forever (Yeah, yeah)

I know you wanna leave, so c'mon

Baby, be with me so happily

I don't care what people say when we're together

You know I wanna be the one

Who'll hold you when you sleep

I just want it to be you and I forever

I know you wanna leave, so c'mon

Baby, be with me so happily

### Right Now 

Lights go down, and

The night is calling to me, yeah

I hear voices

Singing songs in the street, and I know

That we won't be going home

For so long, for so long, but I know

That I won't be on my own

Yeah, I love this feeling and

Right now I wish you were here with me (Ooh)

'Cause right now, everything is new to me (Ooh)

You know, I can't fight the feeling

And every night I feel it

Right now I wish you were here with me (Ooh)

Late-night spaces

With all our friends, you and me, yeah

Love these faces

Just like how it used to be

And we won't be going home

For so long, for so long, but I know

I won't be on my own

On my own, I'm feeling like

Right now I wish you were here with me (Ooh)

'Cause right now everything is new to me (Ooh)

You know, I can't fight the feeling

And every night I feel it

Right now I wish you were here with me (Ooh)

And I could do this forever (Woah, woah-oh)

And let's go crazy together (Woah, woah-oh)

Lights go down, and

I hear you calling to me, yeah

Right now I wish you were here with me (Ooh)

'Cause right now everything is new to me (Ooh)

You know, I can't fight the feeling

And every night I feel it

Right now I wish you were here with me (Ooh)

### Little Black Dress 

Little black dress just walked into the room

Makin' heads turn, can't stop looking at you

It's so right, it's so right, it's so right, you know

Little black dress, did you come here alone?

It's too late, it's too late, it's too late to go home

It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, you know

It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, you know

I wanna see the way you move for me, baby

I wanna see the way you move for me, baby

### Through the Dark 

You tell me that you're sad and lost your way

You tell me that your tears are here to stay

But I know you were only hidin'

And I just wanna see ya

You tell me that you're hurt and you're in pain

And I can see your head is held in shame

But I just wanna see you smile again

See you smile again

But don't burn out

Even if you scream and shout

It'll come back to you

And I'll be here for you

Oh, I will carry you over

Fire and water for your love

And I will hold you closer

Hope your heart is strong enough

When the night is coming down on ya

We will find a way

Through the dark

I wish that I could take you to the start

I'd never let you fall and break your heart

And if you wanna cry or fall apart

I'll be there to hold ya

You tell me that you're hurt, it's all in vain

But I can see your heart can love again

And I remember you laughin'

So let's just laugh again

But don't burn out

Even if you scream and shout

It'll come back to you

Back to you

Oh, I will carry you over

Fire and water for your love

And I will hold you closer

Hope your heart is strong enough

When the night is coming down on ya

We will find a way

Through the dark

And you don't need, you don't need to worry

And you will see, it's easy to be loved

I know you wanna be loved

Oh, I will carry you over

Fire and water for your love

Oh, I will carry you over

Fire and water for your love

And I will hold you closer

Hope your heart is strong enough

When the night is coming down on ya

Through the dark

Oh, I will carry you over (Oh, I would, oh, I would)

Fire and water for your love

And I will hold you closer

Hope your heart is strong enough

When the night is coming down

We will find a way

Through the dark

### Does He Know? 

He knows about you in every way

He's memorised every part of your face

Inside and out, baby, head to toe

Yeah, he knows everything there is to know

Your secret tattoo, the way you change moods

The songs that you sing when you're all alone

Your favourite band, the way that you dance

But baby, baby

Does he know you can move it like that? Woah

Does he know you're out and I want you so bad? Oh

Tonight, you're mine, baby

Does he know that you'll never go back? Oh

Does he know?

I catch your eye, then you turn away

But there's no hidin' the smile on your face

Inside and out, baby, head to toe

He's not around and girl, you let me know

### Alive 

My mother told me I should go and get some therapy

I asked the doctor, "Can you find out what is wrong with me?"

I don't know why I wanna be with every girl I meet

I can't control it, yeah, I know it's takin' over me

I'm going crazy, can't contain it

So tell me just what I should do

She said, "Hey, it's alright, does it make you feel alive?

Don't look back, live your life, even if it's only for tonight"

She said, "Hey, it's alright if it makes you feel alive"

Went to a party just after the doctor talked to me

I met a girl, I took her hand up to the balcony

I whispered somethin' in her ear that I just can't repeat

She said, "Okay," but she was worried what her friends would think

She's going crazy, can't contain it

She asked me, "What should I do?" Oh

I said, "Hey, it's alright, does it make you feel alive?

Don't look back, live your life, even if it's only for tonight"

I said, "Hey, it's alright if it makes you feel alive"

We gotta live before we get older

Do what we like, we got nothing to lose

Shake off the weight of the world from your shoulders

Woah, we've got nothing to prove

I said, "Hey, it's alright, does it make you feel alive?

Don't look back, live your life, even if it's only for tonight"

I said, "Hey (Hey!), it's alright, does it make you feel alive?

Don't look back (Hey!), live your life, even if it's only for tonight"

I said, "Hey (Hey!), it's alright if it makes you feel alive"

### Half a Heart 

So your friend's been telling me

You've been sleepin' with my sweater

And that you can't stop missin' me

Bet my friend's been telling you

I'm not doin' much better

Because I'm missin' half of me

And bein' here without you

Is like I'm wakin' up to

Only half a blue sky

Kinda there, but not quite

I'm walking around with just one shoe

I'm half a heart without you

I'm half a man, at best

With half an arrow in my chest

'Cause I miss everything we do

I'm half a heart without you

Forget all we said that night

No, it doesn't even matter

'Cause we both got split in two

If you could spare an hour or so

We'll go for lunch down by the river

We can really talk it through

And bein' here without you

Is like I'm wakin' up to

Only half a blue sky

Well, kinda there, but not quite

I'm walking around with just one shoe

I'm half a heart without you

I'm half a man, at best

With half an arrow in my chest

'Cause I miss everything we do

I'm half a heart without you

I'm half a heart without you

I'm half a heart without you

Though I try to get you out of my head

The truth is, I got lost without you

And since then, I've been wakin' up to

Only half a blue sky (Only half a blue sky)

Kinda there, but not quite

I'm walking around with just one shoe

I'm half a heart without you

I'm half a man, at best (I'm half a man, at best)

With half an arrow in my chest

I miss everything we do

I'm half a heart without you

Without you, without you

Half a heart without you (Without you, without you)

Without you, without you

I'm half a heart without you

### Where Do Broken Hearts Go 

Counted all my mistakes and there's only one

Standin' out from the list of the things I've done

All the rest of my crimes don't come close

To the look on your face when I let you go

So, I built you a house from a broken home

Then I wrote you a song with the words you spoke

Love was something you never heard enough

How to fix up a heart that I let down

Now, I'm searchin' every lonely place

Every corner, callin' out your name

### Fool's Gold 

I'm like a crow on a wire

You're the shinin' distraction that makes me fly home

I'm like a boat on the water

You're the raise on the waves that calm my mind, oh, every time

But I know in my heart

You're not a constant star

And, yeah, I've let you use me from the day that we first met

But I'm not done yet

Falling for your fool's gold

And I knew that you turned it on for everyone you met

But I don't regret

Falling for your fool's gold

I'm the first to admit that I'm reckless

I get lost in your beauty and I can't see two feet in front of me

And I know in my heart

You're just a moving part

Falling for your fool's gold

Oh

Oh, hmm

### Night Changes 

Goin' out tonight, changes into somethin' red

Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress

Everything she never had, she's showin' off

Drivin' too fast, moon is breakin' through her hair

She's headin' for somethin' that she won't forget

Havin' no regrets is all that she really wants

(Ooh) We're only gettin' older, baby

(Ooh) And I've been thinkin' about it lately

(Ooh) Does it ever drive you crazy

(Ah-ah-ah) Just how fast the night changes?

(Ooh) Everything that you've ever dreamed of

(Ooh) Disappearin' when you wake up

(Ooh) But there's nothin' to be afraid of

(Ah-ah-ah) Even when the night changes

(Ooh) It will never change me and you

Chasin' her tonight, doubts are runnin' round her head

He's waitin', hides behind a cigarette

Heart is beatin' loud and she doesn't want it to stop

Movin' too fast, moon is lightin' up her skin

She's fallin', doesn't even know it yet

Havin' no regrets is all that she really wants

(Ooh) We're only gettin' older, baby

(Ooh) And I've been thinkin' about it lately

(Ooh) Does it ever drive you crazy

(Ah-ah-ah) Just how fast the night changes?

(Ooh) Everything that you've ever dreamed of

(Ooh) Disappearin' when you wake up

(Ooh) But there's nothin' to be afraid of

(Ah-ah-ah) Even when the night changes

(Ooh) It will never change me and you

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Ooh, ooh, ooh

Ooh

Goin' out tonight, changes into somethin' red

Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress

Reminds her of the missin' piece of innocence she lost

(Ooh) We're only gettin' older, baby

(Ooh) And I've been thinkin' about it lately

(Ooh) Does it ever drive you crazy

(Ah-ah-ah) Just how fast the night changes?

(Ooh) Everything that you've ever dreamed of

(Ooh) Disappearin' when you wake up

(Ooh) But there's nothin' to be afraid of

(Ah-ah-ah) Even when the night changes

(Ooh) It will never change, baby

(Ooh) It will never change, baby

(Ooh) It will never change me and you

### No Control 

Oh

(Oh, oh)

Stained coffee cup

Just a fingerprint of lipstick's not enough

Sweet (Oh), where you lay (Oh)

Still a trace of innocence on the pillow case

Waking up beside you, I'm a loaded gun

I can't contain this anymore

I'm all yours, I've got no control, no control

Powerless, and I don't care it's obvious

I just can't get enough of you

The pedal's down, my eyes are closed, no control

(Oh)

Oh

(Oh)

Taste on my tongue

I don't want to wash away the night before

In the heat (Oh), where you lay (Oh)

I could stay right here and burn in it all day

Waking up beside you, I'm a loaded gun

I can't contain this anymore

I'm all yours, I've got no control, no control

Powerless, and I don't care it's obvious

I just can't get enough of you

The pedal's down, my eyes are closed, no control

Lost my senses, I'm defenseless

Her perfume's holding me ransom

Sweet and sour, heart devoured

Lying here, I count the hours

Waking up, beside you I'm a loaded gun

I can't contain this anymore

I'm all yours, I've got no control, no control

Powerless, and I don't care it's obvious

I just can't get enough of you

The pedal's down, my eyes are closed, no control

Oh

No control

Oh

No control

Powerless, and I don't care it's obvious

I just can't get enough of you

The pedal's down, my eyes are closed, no control

### Fireproof 

I think I'm gonna lose my mind

Something deep inside me, I can't give up

I think I'm gonna lose my mind

I roll and I roll 'til I'm out of luck

Yeah, I roll and I roll 'til I'm out of luck (Ah)

I'm feeling something deep inside (Ah)

Hotter than a jet stream burning up (Ah)

I got a feeling deep inside (Ah)

It's taking, it's taking all I've got (Ah)

Yeah, it's taking, it's taking all I've got

'Cause nobody knows you, baby, the way I do

And nobody loves you, baby, the way I do

It's been so long, it's been so long, maybe you were fireproof

'Cause nobody saves me, baby, the way you do

I think I'm gonna win this time

Ridin' on the wind and I won't give up

I think I'm gonna win this time

I roll and I roll 'til I change my luck

Yeah, I roll and I roll 'til I change my luck (Ah)

'Cause nobody knows you, baby, the way I do

And nobody loves you, baby, the way I do

It's been so long (Ah), it's been so long, you must be fireproof

'Cause nobody saves me, baby, the way you do

('Cause nobody knows you, baby, the way I do)

(And nobody loves you, baby, the way I do)

It's been so long, it's been so long (Ah), maybe you were fireproof

'Cause nobody saves me, baby, the way you do

### Spaces 

Who's gonna be the first one to start the fight?

Who's gonna be the first one to fall asleep at night?

Who's gonna be the last one to drive away?

Who's gonna be the last one to forget this place?

We keep taking turns (Oh-oh-oh-oh)

Will we ever learn?

Oh, spaces between us keep getting deeper

It's harder to reach ya, even though I've tried

Spaces between us hold all our secrets

Leavin' us speechless and I don't know why

Who's gonna be the first to say goodbye?

Bye

Who's gonna be the first one to compromise?

Who's gonna be the first one to set it all on fire?

Who's gonna be the last one to drive away?

Forgetting every single promise we ever made

Oh, spaces between us keep getting deeper

It's harder to reach ya, even though I've tried

Spaces between us hold all our secrets

Leavin' us speechless and I don't know why

Who's gonna be the first to say goodbye?

Bye

We keep taking turns (Oh-oh-oh-oh)

Will we ever learn? (Oh-oh-oh-oh)

When will we learn?

Oh, spaces between us keep getting deeper

It's harder to reach ya, even though I've tried

Spaces between us hold all our secrets

Leavin' us speechless and I don't know why

Who's gonna be the first to say goodbye?

Bye

Who's gonna be the first to say goodbye?

The spaces between us

The spaces between us

The spaces between us

The spaces between us

### Stockholm Syndrome 

Who's that shadow holding me hostage? I've been here for days

Who's this whisper telling me that I'm never gonna get away?

I know they'll be coming to find me soon

But I fear I'm getting used to

Being held by you

Oh, baby, look what you've done to me

Oh, baby, look what you've done now

Oh, baby, I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way (Oh-oh-oh)

Oh, baby, look what you've done to me

Oh, baby, you got me tied down

Oh, baby, I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way (Oh-oh-oh)

Who's this man that's holding your hand and talking 'bout your eyes? (Oh-oh-oh)

Used to sing about being free but now he's changed his mind (Oh-oh-oh)

I know they'll be coming to find me soon

But my Stockholm syndrome is in your room

Yeah, I fell for you

Oh, baby, look what you've done to me

Oh, baby, look what you've done now

Oh, baby, I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way (Oh-oh-oh)

Oh, baby, look what you've done to me

Oh, baby, you got me tied down

Oh, baby, I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way (Oh-oh-oh)

All my life, I've been on my own (Oh-oh-oh)

I used the light to guide me home (Oh-oh-oh)

But now together we're alone (Oh-oh-oh)

And there's no other place I'd ever wanna go

(Look what you've done to me)

Baby, look what you've done

Oh, baby, look what you've done to me

Oh, baby, look what you've done (Done) now

Oh, baby, I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way (Oh-oh-oh)

(Look what you've done to me, baby)

Oh, baby, look what you've done to me

Oh, baby, you got me tied down

(Look what you've done to me, baby)

Oh, baby, I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way (Oh-oh-oh)

(Look what you've done to me, baby)

Oh, baby, look what you've done

(Look what you've done to me, baby)

(Oh-oh-oh) Oh, baby, look what you've done to me

(Look what you've done to me, baby)

### Clouds 

Oh-oh-oh-oh (Clouds)

Oh-oh-oh-oh (Clouds)

I know you say that you don't like it complicated

That we should try to keep it simple

But love is never, ever simple, no

Someday, you're gonna see the things that I see

You're gonna want the air that I breathe

You're gonna wish you never left me

Here we go again

Another go-round for all of my friends

Another non-stop, will it ever end?

Here we go again

Another go-round for all of my friends

Another non-stop, will it ever end?

If we're never comin' back down

Oh-oh-oh-oh

Oh-oh-oh-oh

I know you said that you don't like it complicated

That you are tired of all the changes

Well, love is always, always changing, woah

But someday, you're gonna see the things that I see

You're gonna want the air that I breathe

You're gonna wish you never left me

Here we go again

Another go-round for all of my friends

Another non-stop, will it ever end?

Here we go again

Another go-round for all of my friends

Another non-stop, will it ever end?

If we're never comin' back down

### Perfect 

I might never be your knight in shinin' armour

I might never be the one you take home to mother

And I might never be the one who brings you flowers

But I can be the one, be the one tonight

When I first saw you from across the room

I could tell that you were curious, oh, yeah

Girl, I hope you're sure what you're looking for

'Cause I'm not good at making promises

But if you like causing trouble up in hotel rooms

And if you like having secret little rendezvous

If you like to do the things you know that we shouldn't do

Then, baby, I'm perfect

Baby, I'm perfect for you

And if you like midnight driving with the windows down

And if you like goin' places we can't even pronounce

If you like to do whatever you've been dreamin' about

Then, baby, you're perfect

Baby, you're perfect

So let's start right now

I might never be the hands you put your heart in

Or the arms that hold you any time you want them

But that don't mean that we can't live here in the moment

'Cause I can be the one you love from time to time

When I first saw you from across the room

I could tell that you were curious, oh, yeah

Girl, I hope you're sure what you're looking for

'Cause I'm not good at making promises

But if you like causing trouble up in hotel rooms

And if you like having secret little rendezvous

If you like to do the things you know that we shouldn't do

Then, baby, I'm perfect

Baby, I'm perfect for you

Then, baby, you're perfect

Baby, you're perfect

So let's start right now

And if you like cameras flashin' every time we go out

Oh, yeah

And if you're looking for someone to write your breakup songs about

Then baby, I'm perfect

And baby, we're perfect

If you like causing trouble up in hotel rooms

And if you like having secret little rendezvous

If you like to do the things you know that we shouldn't do

Then, baby, I'm perfect

Baby, I'm perfect for you

And if you like midnight driving with the windows down

Baby, you're perfect

So let's start right now

### Infinity 

Down to Earth

Keep on falling when I know it hurts

Going faster than a million miles an hour

Tryna catch my breath some way, somehow

Down to Earth

It's like I'm frozen but the world still turns

Stuck in motion and the wheels keep spinning 'round

Moving in reverse with no way out

And now I'm one step closer to being

Two steps far from you

When everybody wants you

Everybody wants you

How many nights does it take to count the stars?

That's the time it would take to fix my heart

Oh, baby, I was there for you

All I ever wanted was the truth, yeah, yeah

How many nights have you wished someone would stay?

Lie awake, only hoping they're okay

I never counted all of mine

If I tried, I know it would feel like infinity

Infinity, infinity, yeah

Infinity

Eyes can't shine

Unless there's something burning bright behind

Since you went away, there's nothing left in mine

I feel myself runnin' out of time

And now I'm one step closer to being

Two steps far from you

When everybody wants you

Everybody wants you

How many nights does it take to count the stars?

That's the time it would take to fix my heart

Oh, baby, I was there for you

All I ever wanted was the truth, yeah, yeah

How many nights have you wished someone would stay?

Lie awake only hoping they're okay

I never counted all of mine

If I tried, I know it would feel like infinity

Infinity, infinity, yeah

Infinity (Infinity, infinity, infinity, infinity)

Infinity (Infinity, infinity, infinity, infinity)

How many nights does it take to count the stars?

That's the time it would take to fix my heart

Oh, baby, I was there for you

All I ever wanted was the truth, yeah, yeah

(All I ever wanted was the truth, yeah, yeah)

How many nights have you wished someone would stay?

Lie awake only hoping they're okay (Yeah, yeah)

I never counted all of mine

If I tried, I know it would feel like infinity (Infinity)

Infinity (Infinity), infinity, yeah

Infinity

### End of the Day 

I told her that I loved her, was not sure if she heard

The roof was pretty windy and she didn't say a word

Party dying downstairs, had nothing left to do

Just me, her and the moon

I said, "You're on fire, babe"

Then down came the lightning on me

Love can be frightening for sure

All I know at the end of the day

Is you want what you want and you say what you say

And you follow your heart even though it'll break sometimes

All I know at the end of the day

Is you love who you love, there ain't no other way

If there's something I've learned from a million mistakes

You're the one that I want at the end of the day

(Oh, oh)

At the end of the day

(Oh, I, I, I)

You're the one that I want at the end of the day

She said the night was over, I said it's forever

Twenty minutes later, wound up in the hospital

The priest thinks it's the devil, my mum thinks it's the flu

But, girl, it's only you

I said, "You're on fire, babe"

Then down came the lightning on me

Love can be frightening for sure

All I know at the end of the day

Is you want what you want and you say what you say

And you follow your heart even though it'll break sometimes

All I know at the end of the day (All I know)

Is you love who you love, there ain't no other way

If there's something I've learned from a million mistakes

You're the one that I want at the end of the day (At the end of the day)

When the sun goes down

I know that you and me and everything will be alright

And when the city's sleeping

You and I can stay awake, can keep on dreaming

You and I can stay awake, can keep on dreaming

All I know at the end of the day

Is you want what you want and you say what you say

And you follow your heart even though it'll break sometimes

All I know at the end of the day (All I know at the end of the day)

Is you love who you love, there ain't no other way

If there's something I've learned from a million mistakes

You're the one that I want at the end of the day (At the end of the day, yeah)

(Oh, oh)

At the end of the day

(Oh, I, I, I)

You're the one that I want at the end of the day (At the end of the day)

(Oh, oh)

(Oh, I, I, I)

You're the one that I want at the end of the day

### If I Could Fly 

If I could fly

I'd be coming right back home to you

I think I might

Give up everything, just ask me to

Pay attention, I hope that you listen

'Cause I let my guard down

Right now, I'm completely defenceless

For your eyes only, I show you my heart

For when you're lonely and forget who you are

I'm missing half of me when we're apart

Now you know me, for your eyes only

For your eyes only

I've got scars

Even though they can't always be seen

And pain gets hard

But now you're here and I don't feel a thing

Pay attention, I hope that you listen

'Cause I let my guard down

Right now, I'm completely defenceless

For your eyes only, I show you my heart

For when you're lonely and forget who you are

I'm missing half of me when we're apart

Now you know me, for your eyes only

For your eyes only

I can feel your heart inside of mine (I feel it, I feel it)

I've been going out of my mind (I feel it, I feel it)

Know that I'm just wasting time (And I)

Hope that you don't run from me

For your eyes only, I show you my heart

For when you're lonely and forget who you are

I'm missing half of me when we're apart

(Now you know me, for your eyes only)

For your eyes only, I show you my heart (Show you my heart)

For when you're lonely and forget who you are (Forget who you are)

I'm missing half of me when we're apart

Now you know me, for your eyes only

For your eyes only

For your eyes only

### Long Way Down 

We made a fire, went down in the flames

We sailed an ocean and drowned in the wave

Built a cathedral, but we never prayed

We had it all, yeah, and we walked away

Point of no return and now it's just too late to turn around

I try to forgive you but I struggle 'cause I don't know how

We built it up so high and now I'm falling

It's a long way down, it's a long way down from here

We had a mountain, but took it for granted

We had a spaceship, but we couldn't land it

We found an island, but we got stranded

We had it all, yeah, who could've planned it?

Point of no return and now it's just too late to turn around

I try to forgive you, but I'm struggling 'cause I don't know how

We built it up so high and now I'm falling

It's a long way down from here

Such a long way down from here

It's a long way down

It's a long way down

Such a long way down

It's a long way down

It's a long way down

### Never Enough 

Wanna pull an all-nighter and get into something we'll never forget

Wanna stay up and party the weekend away and not know when to quit

Wanna drive in the night to the end of the earth and go over the edge

Wanna wake up with you and say, "Baby, let's do it all over again"

Lips so good I forget my name

I swear I could give you everything

I don't need my love, you can take it

You can take it and take it

I don't need my heart, you can break it

You can break it and break it

I just can't get too much of you, baby

It's never, it's never enough

Never enough

### Olivia 

Forty-three

And then?

And then you've gotta play the opposite part which means you, you rest for four bars

Right, so we stop there?

Right

Remember the day we were giving up

When you told me I didn't give you enough

And all of your friends were saying I'd be leaving ya?

She's lyin' in bed with my t-shirt on

Just thinking how I went about it wrong

This isn't the stain of a red wine, I'm bleeding love

Please, believe me, don't you see the things you mean to me?

Oh, I love you, I love you, I love, I love, I love Olivia

I live for you, I long for you, Olivia (Ayy, ayy)

I've been idolizing the light in your eyes, Olivia (Ayy, ayy)

I live for you, I long for you, Olivia

Don't let me go, don't let me go

Say what you're feelin' and say it now

'Cause I got the feelin' you're walkin' out

And time is irrelevant when I've not been seeing ya

The consequences of falling out

Are something I'm having nightmares about

And these are the reasons I'm cryin' out to be with ya

Please, believe me, don't you see the things you mean to me?

Oh, I love you, I love you, I love, I love, I love Olivia

I live for you, I long for you, Olivia (Ayy, ayy)

I've been idolizing the light in your eyes, Olivia (Ayy, ayy)

I live for you, I long for you, Olivia

Don't let me go, (Don't) don't let me go (Go)

When you go and I'm alone

You live in my imagination

The summertime and butterflies

All belong to your creation

I love you, it's all I do, I love you

I live for you, I long for you, Olivia (Ayy, ayy)

I've been idolizing the light in your eyes, Olivia (Ayy, ayy)

I live for you, I long for you, Olivia

Don't let me go (Don't), don't let me go (Go)

Don't let me go, Olivia

No way

Thank you

### What a Feeling 

Through the wire, through the wire, through the wire

I'm watching her dance, dress is catching the light

In her eyes, there's no lies, no lies

There's no question, she's not in a disguise

With no way out and a long way down

Everybody needs someone around

But I can't hold you too close now

Through the wire, through the wire

What a feeling to be right here beside you now

Holding you in my arms

When the air ran out and we both started running wild

The sky fell down

But you've got stars, they're in your eyes

And I've got something missing tonight

What a feeling to be a king beside you, somehow

I wish I could be there now

Through the wire, through the wire, through the wire

I'm watching you like this, imaginin' you're mine

It's too late, it's too late, am I too late?

Tell me now, am I runnin' out of time?

With no way out and a long way down

Everybody needs someone around

But I can't hold you too close now

Through the wire, through the wire

What a feeling to be right here beside you now

Holding you in my arms

When the air ran out and we both started running wild

The sky fell down

But you've got stars, they're in your eyes

And I've got something missing tonight

What a feeling to be a king beside you, somehow

I wish I could be there now

Whatever chains are holdin' you back

Holdin' you back, don't let 'em tie you down

Whatever change is holdin' you back

Holdin' you back, tell me you believe in that

What a feeling to be right here beside you now

Holding you in my arms

When the air ran out and we both started running wild

The sky fell down

But you've got stars, they're in your eyes

And I've got something missing tonight

What a feeling to be a king beside you, somehow

I wish I could be there now

I wish I could be there now

### Love You Goodbye 

It's inevitable, everything that's good comes to an end

It's impossible to know if after this we can still be friends, yeah

I know you're sayin' you don't wanna hurt me

Well, maybe you should show a little mercy

The way you look, I know you didn't come to apologise

Hey, hey, hey

Oh, why you wearing that to walk out of my life?

Hey, hey, hey

Oh, even though it's over, you should stay tonight

Hey, hey, hey

If tomorrow you won't be mine

Won't you give it to me one last time?

Oh, baby, let me love you goodbye

Unforgettable together, held the whole world in our hands

Unexplainable, a love that only we could understand, yeah

I know there's nothing I can do to change it

But is there something that can be negotiated?

My heart's already breaking, baby, go on, twist the knife

Hey, hey, hey

Oh, why you wearing that to walk out of my life?

Hey, hey, hey

Oh, even though it's over, you should stay tonight

Hey, hey, hey

If tomorrow you won't be mine

Won't you give it to me one last time?

Oh, baby, let me love you goodbye

Oh, baby, let me love you goodbye

One more taste of your lips just to bring me back

To the places we've been and the nights we've had

Because if this is it, then at least we could end it right

Oh, why you wearing that to walk out of my life?

Hey, hey, hey

Oh, even though it's over, you should stay the night, yeah

Hey, hey, hey

If tomorrow you won't be mine

Won't you give it to me one last time?

Oh, baby, let me love you goodbye

Oh, baby, let me love you goodbye

Oh, baby, let me love you goodbye

### I Want to Write You a Song 

I wanna write you a song

One as beautiful as you are sweet

With just a hint of pain

For the feeling that I get when you are gone

I wanna write you a song

I wanna lend you my coat

One that's as soft as your cheek

So when the world is cold

You will have a hiding place you can go

I wanna lend you my coat

Ooh, everything I need I get from you

Ooh, and giving back is all I wanna do

I wanna build you a boat

One as strong as you are free

So any time you think

That your heart is gonna sink, you know it won't

I wanna build you a boat

Ooh, everything I need I get from you

Ooh, and giving back is all I wanna do, ooh

Ooh, everything I need I get from you

Ooh, giving back is all I wanna do, ooh

I wanna write you a song

One to make your heart remember me

So any time I'm gone

You can listen to my voice and sing along

I wanna write you a song

I wanna write you a song

### History 

You gotta help me

I'm losing my mind

Keep getting the feelin'

You wanna leave this all behind

Thought we were going strong

I thought we were holdin' on

Aren't we?

No, they don't teach ya

This in school

That the world has ever seen

You and me got a whole lot of history (Oh)

Aren't we?

You and me got a whole lot of history (Oh)

We could be the greatest team

That the world has ever seen

You and me got a whole lot of history (Oh)

So don't let it go, we can make some more

We can live forever

Minibars, expensive cars

Hotel rooms and new tattoos

The good champagne and private planes

But they don't mean anything

'Cause the truth is out, I realise

That without you here, life is just a lie

This is not the end, this is not the end

We can make it, you know it, you know

You and me got a whole lot of history (Oh)

We could be the greatest team

That the world has ever seen

You and me got a whole lot of history (Oh)

So don't let it go, we can make some more

We can live forever

You and me got a whole lot of history (Oh)

We could be the greatest team

That the world has ever seen

You and me got a whole lot of history (Oh)

So don't let it go, we can make some more

We can live forever

So don't let me go, so don't let me go

We can live forever

Baby, don't you know? Baby, don't you know?

We can live forever

Ridin' on the wind and I won't give up

I think I'm gonna win this time

I roll and I roll 'til I change my luck

Yeah, I roll and I roll 'til I change my luck (Ah)

'Cause nobody knows you, baby, the way I do

And nobody loves you, baby, the way I do

It's been so long (Ah), it's been so long, you must be fireproof

# Sing Along

## Wasted Love  

I'm an ocean of love

And you're scared of water

You don't want to go under

So you let me go under

I reach out my hand

But you watch me grow distant

Drift out to the sea and

Far away in an instant

You left me in the deep end

I'm drownin' in my feelings

How do you not see that?

Now that you're gone

All I have

Is wasted love

This wasted love

Now that you're gone

Can't fill my heart

With wasted love

This wasted love

When you let me go

I barely stayed afloat

I'm floatin' all alone

Still, I'm holdin' on to hope

Now that you're gone

All I have

Is wasted love

This wasted love

Now that you're gone

Can't fill my heart

With wasted love

This wasted love

Wasted love

This wasted

Wasted, wasted, wasted, wasted

Wasted, wasted, wasted, wasted

Love (Wasted, wasted, wasted, wasted)

Love

## I'm In Love With a Monster  

Oh

He'll buy me a thorn before he'll buy me a rose

Be covered in dirt before I'm covered in gold

He's trying it on, yeah, he's ticking me off

Say what you want, but I won't ever be told

'Cause I'm in love with a monster

(Ooh, ooh, ah-ooh)

Friends say I'm stupid and I'm out of my mind

But without you, boy, I'd be bored all the time

No, I don't really care for the same conversation

Got everythin' I need and I'd rather be chasing

Chasing love with a monster

(Ooh, ooh, ah-ooh)

I'm in love (I'm in love)

I'm in love (I'm in love)

I'm in love with a monster (Ooh, ooh, ooh)

I'm in love with a monster

(Ooh, ooh, ah-ooh)

Wrap me in leather before you wrap me in lace

We breakin' rules like we changing the game

He's tryin' it on, and he's ticking me off

Say what you want, but I won't ever be told

I'm in love with a monster with a monster

(Ooh, ooh, ah-ooh)

My nana told me I should have better taste

But I'd rather pay to see the look on her face

No, I don't really care for the lame conversation

Got everything I need, and I'd rather be chasing

Chasing love with a monster

(Ooh, ooh, ah-ooh, aw!)

I'm in love (I'm in love)

(Ooh, ooh, ah-ooh, *hey*)

Sweeter you try, they don't be gettin' love from it

Ain't worth a dime 'cause I just don't get enough from it

Leave it to me, don't you see, I don't run from it

The bitter the better (Hey, hey, hey, hey)

You make me crazy, but I love it (I love it, babe)

You make me crazy, baby, but I love it (Bite it, baby, yeah)

You make me crazy (Oh, oh), but I love it

You make me crazy, baby, but I love it

Hit me

One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, hit!

Thank you, goodnight

## Touch It  

How do I make the phone ring?

Why do I even care?

How are you all around me, when you're not really there? (Mm)

When you're not really there? (Hey, yeah, mm)

How do I feel you on me, when you're not on my skin?

Why do you say you want me, then tell me you're not coming in? (Ah, yeah)

Baby, just come on in (Mm, yeah)

'Cause every time I'm with you, I go into a zone

And I remember all the places you wanna go

Take me all the way (Ooh)

Ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it

'Cause every time I see you, I don't wanna behave

I'm tired of being patient, so let's pick up the pace

Take me all the way (Ooh)

Ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it

How do you know I'm breathing, when I'm holding my breath?

Why don't we face the danger, just for the night and forget? (Ayy)

Baby, let's just forget (No-oh)

Remind me why we're taking a break

It's obviously insane

'Cause we both know what we want

So why don't we fall in love?

Baby, let's fall in love, oh-oh

'Cause every time I'm with you, I go into a zone

And I remember all the places you wanna go

Take me all the way (Ooh)

Ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it

'Cause every time I see you, I don't wanna behave

I'm tired of being patient, so let's pick up the pace

Take me all the way (Ooh)

Ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it

Oh, ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it

Baby, ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it (Ain't no-bo-dy, babe)

Baby, ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it (Oh)

Ain't nobody gonna touch it (Oh, no, ayy)

Remind me why we're taking a break

It's obviously insane

'Cause we both know what we want

So why don't we fall in love?

Baby, let's be in love

'Cause every time I'm with you, I go into a zone

And I remember all the places you wanna go

Take me all the way (Ooh)

No, ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it (Ain't nobody gonna)

'Cause every time I see you, I don't wanna behave (Behave)

I'm tired of being patient, so let's pick up the pace

Take me all the way (Ooh; Ooh)

Ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it (Ah-ah, ooh)

(Ooh, ooh-ooh)

Baby, ain't nobody gonna (Baby)

Baby, ain't nobody gonna (Ah-ah; Woah, oh)

Baby, ain't nobody gonna (Ooh-ooh)

## Save Me  

Loving you like I never have before

I'm needing you to open up the door

If begging you might somehow turn the tides

Then tell me to I've got to get this off my mind

I never thought I'd be speaking these words

I never thought I'd need to say

Another day alone is more than I can take

Won't you save me

Saving is what I need

I just want to be by your side

Won't you save me I don't want to be

Just drifting through the sea of life

Won't you

Listen, please baby, don't walk out that door

I'm on my knees you're all I'm living for

I never thought I'd be speaking these words

Heaven thought I'd find a way

Another day alone is more than I can take

Won't you save me

Saving is what I need

I just want to be by your side

Won't you save me I don't want to be

Just drifting through the sea of life

If suddenly the sky is falling

Could it be too late for me

If I never said I'm sorry, then I'm wrong, yes, I'm wrong

Then I hear my spirit calling

Wondering if she's longing for me

And then I know that I can't live without her

Won't you save me

Saving is what I need

I just want to be by your side

Won't you save me I don't want to be

Just drifting through this sea of life

Won't you save me

Won't you save me

Won't you save me

## Jar of hearts  

No, I can't take one more step towards you

'Cause all that's waiting is regret

And don't you know I'm not your ghost anymore?

You lost the love I loved the most

I learned to live half alive

And now you want me one more time

And who do you think you are?

Runnin' 'round leaving scars

Collecting your jar of hearts

And tearing love apart

You're gonna catch a cold

From the ice inside your soul

So don't come back for me

Who do you think you are?

I hear you're asking all around

If I am anywhere to be found

I have grown too strong

To ever fall back in your arms

I've learned to live half alive

And now you want me one more time

And who do you think you are?

Runnin' 'round leaving scars

Collecting your jar of hearts

And tearing love apart

You're gonna catch a cold

From the ice inside your soul

So don't come back for me

Who do you think you are?

It took so long just to feel alright

Remember how to put back the light in my eyes

I wish I had missed the first time that we kissed

'Cause you broke all your promises

And now you're back

You don't get to get me back

And who do you think you are?

Runnin' 'round leaving scars

Collecting your jar of hearts

And tearing love apart

You're gonna catch a cold

From the ice inside your soul

Don't come back for me

Don't come back at all

And who do you think you are?

Runnin' 'round leaving scars

Collecting your jar of hearts

And tearing love apart

You're gonna catch a cold

From the ice inside your soul

Don't come back for me

Don't come back at all

Who do you think you are?

Who do you think you are?

Who do you think you are?

## Need You Now  

"Hey, sorry I missed your call, just leave a message after the beep"

"Hey, yeah, it's me, just been thinking about everything tonight

And I don't know, I just miss you so much

Give me a call back if you can?"

Picture-perfect memories scattered all around the floor

Reachin' for the phone 'cause I can't fight it anymore

And I wonder if I ever cross your mind

For me, it happens all the time

It's a quarter after 1, I'm all alone and I need you now

Said I wouldn't call, but I've lost all control and I need you now

And I don't know how I can do without

I just need you now

Another shot of whiskey, can't stop lookin' at the door

Wishing you'd come sweeping in the way you did before

And I wonder if I ever cross your mind

For me, it happens all the time

It's a quarter after 1, I'm a little drunk and I need you now

Said I wouldn't call, but I've lost all control and I need you now

And I don't know how I can do without

I just need you now

Woah, oh

I guess I'd rather hurt than feel nothin' at all

It's a quarter after 1, I'm all alone and I need you now

And I said I wouldn't call, but I'm a little drunk and I need you now

And I don't know how I can do without

I just need you now

I just need you now

Oh, baby, I need you now

## somebody that i used to know  

Now and then, I think of when we were together

Like when you said you felt so happy, you could die

I told myself that you were right for me

But felt so lonely in your company

But that was love and it's an ache I still remember

You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness

Like resignation to the end, always the end

So when we found that we could not make sense

Well, you said that we would still be friends

But I'll admit that I was glad it was over

But you didn't have to cut me off

Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing

And I don't even need your love

But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough

No, you didn't have to stoop so low

Have your friends collect your records and then change your number

I guess that I don't need that, though

Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Now and then, I think of all the times you screwed me over

But had me believing it was always something that I'd done

But I don't wanna live that way

Reading into every word you say

You said that you could let it go

And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know

But you didn't have to cut me off

Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing (Ah)

And I don't even need your love (Ohh)

But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough (Ah)

No, you didn't have to stoop so low (Ohh)

Have your friends collect your records and then change your number (Ah)

I guess that I don't need that, though (Ohh)

Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Somebody (I used to know)

Somebody (Now you're just somebody that I used to know)

Somebody (I used to know)

Somebody (Now you're just somebody that I used to know)

(I used to know)

(That I used to know)

(I used to know)

Somebody

## Shake It Out  

Regrets collect like old friends

Here to relive your darkest moments

I can see no way, I can see no way

And all of the ghouls come out to play

And every demon wants his pound of flesh

But I like to keep some things to myself

I'd like to keep my issues drawn

It's always darkest before the dawn

And I've been a fool and I've been blind

I can never leave the past behind

I can see no way, I can see no way

I'm always dragging that horse around

All of his questions, such a mournful sound

Tonight, I'm gonna bury that horse in the ground

'Cause I like to keep my issues drawn

But it's always darkest before the dawn

Shake it out, shake it out

Shake it out, shake it out, oh-woah

Shake it out, shake it out

Shake it out, shake it out, oh-woah

And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back

So shake him off, oh-woah

And I am done with my graceless heart

So tonight, I'm gonna cut it out and then restart

'Cause I like to keep my issues drawn

It's always darkest before the dawn

Shake it out, shake it out

Shake it out, shake it out, oh-woah

Shake it out, shake it out

Shake it out, shake it out, oh-woah

And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back

So shake him off, oh-woah (Shake him off)

And it's hard to dance

With a devil on your back (Shake him off)

And given half the chance

Would I take any of it back? (Shake him off)

It's a fine romance

But it's left me so undone (Shake him off)

It's always darkest before the dawn (Shake him off)

(Oh-woah)

(Oh-woah)

And I'm damned if I do and I'm damned if I don't

So here's to drinks in the dark at the end of my rope

And I'm ready to suffer and I'm ready to hope

It's a shot in the dark aimed right at my throat

'Cause lookin' for Heaven, found the devil in me (Oh-woah)

Looking for Heaven, found the devil in me (Oh-woah)

But what the hell, I'm gonna let it happen to me, yeah

Shake it out, shake it out

Shake it out, shake it out, oh-woah

Shake it out, shake it out

Shake it out, shake it out, oh-woah

And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back

So shake him off, oh-woah

Shake it out, shake it out

Shake it out, shake it out, oh-woah

Shake it out, shake it out

Shake it out, shake it out, oh-woah

And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back

So shake him off, oh-woah

(What the hell) Oh-oh-oh-oh

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Oh-oh-oh-oh

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Oh-oh-oh-oh

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Oh-oh-oh-oh

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Oh-oh-oh-oh

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Oh-oh-oh-oh

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Oh-oh-oh-oh

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Oh-oh-oh-oh

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

## You Get What You Give  

Uh

Cha-cha-cha-cha, cha-cha-cha-cha-cha (ooh)

Cha-cha-cha-cha-cha, cha-cha-cha-cha

Do you know it, do you know it, do you know it, do you know it

One, two!

One, two, three, ow!

Oh, oh, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

Wake up, kids, we got the dreamers' disease

Age fourteen, they got you down on your knees

So polite, we're busy still saying please

Frenemies, who, when you're down, ain't your friend

Every night we smash a Mercedes-Benz

First we run, and then we laugh 'til we cry

But when the night is falling

You cannot find the light (Light)

You feel your dreams are dying, hold tight

You've got the music in you

Don't let go, you've got the music in you

One dance left, this world is gonna pull through

Don't give up, you've got a reason to live

Can't forget, we only get what we give

I'm comin' home, baby

You're the tops

Give it to me now!

Four A.M., we ran a miracle mile

We're flat broke, but hey, we do it in style

The bad rich, God's flying in for your trial

But when the night is falling

You cannot find a friend (Friend)

You feel your tree is breaking, just bend

You've got the music in you

Don't let go, you've got the music in you

One dance left, this world is gonna pull through

Don't give up, you've got a reason to live

Can't forget, we only get what we give

This whole damn world could fall apart

You'll be okay, follow your heart

You're in harm's way, I'm right behind

Now say you're mine

You've got the music in you

Don't let go, you've got the music in you

One dance left, this world is gonna pull through

Don't give up, you've got a reason to live

Can't forget, we only get what we give

Don't let go, I feel the music in you

Don't let go

Fly (fly) high

What's real can't die

You only get what you give

You're gonna get what you give

Don't give up

Just don't be afraid to live

Health insurance, rip-off, lying

FDA, big bankers buying

Fake computer crashes dining

Cloning while they're multiplying

Fashion shoots with Beck and Hanson (Don't give up)

Courtney Love and Marilyn Manson

You're all fakes, run to your mansions

Come around, we'll kick your ass in

Don't let go

One dance left

Don't give up

Can't forget

Don't let go

## In My Life  

There are places I remember

All my life, though some have changed (Ooh, ooh, ooh)

Some forever, not for better

Some have gone and some remain (Ooh, ooh, ooh)

All these places had their moments

With lovers and friends, I still can recall

Some are dead and some are living

In my life, I've loved them all

But of all these friends and lovers

There is no one compares with you (Ooh, ooh, ooh)

And these memories lose their meaning

When I think of love as something new (Ooh, ooh, ooh)

Though I know I'll never lose affection

For people and things that went before

I know I'll often stop and think about them

In my life, I love you more

Though I know I'll never lose affection

For people and things that went before

I know I'll often stop and think about them

In my life, I love you more

In my life, I love you more

## Paradise By The Dashboard Light  

Well, I remember every little thing

As if it happened only yesterday

Parking by the lake

And there was not another car in sight

And I never had a girl

Looking any better than you did

And all the kids at school

They were wishing they were me that night

And now our bodies are oh-so close and tight

It never felt so good, it never felt so right

And we're glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife

Glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife

Come on (Hold tight)

Oh, come on (Hold tight)

Though it's cold and lonely in the deep dark night

I can see paradise by the dashboard light

Though it's cold and lonely in the (deep dark) {Night}

In the deep dark night

Paradise by the (Dashboard light)

We're gonna go all the way tonight

We're gonna go all the way

And tonight's the night

We're gonna go all the way tonight

We're gonna go all the way

And tonight's the night

We're gonna go all the way tonight

We're gonna go all the way

And tonight's the night

We're gonna go all the way tonight

We're gonna go all the way

And tonight's the night

(Night!) Stop right there

I gotta know right now

Before we go any further

Do you love me?

Will you love me forever?

Do you need me?

Will you never leave me?

Will you make me so happy

For the rest of my life?

Will you take me away

And will you make me your wife?

Let me sleep on it (Sleep on it)

Baby, baby let me sleep on it (Sleep on it)

Let me sleep on it (Oooooh, oooooh)

And I'll give you an answer in the {morning}

I gotta know right now

Do you love me? (Do you, do you love me?)

Will you love me forever?

Do you need me? (Do you, do you need me?)

Will you never leave me?

Will you make me so happy (Will you never leave me)

For the rest of my life?

Will you take me away (Do you, do you, do you)

And will you make me your wife?

(with New Directions: Uh, do you love me?)

Will you love me forever?

Let me sleep on it

Will you love me forever?

Let me sleep on it

Will you love me forever?

I couldn't take it any longer

Lord, I was crazed

And when the feeling came upon me

Like a tidal wave

I started (swearing to my god)

And on my (mother's) grave

That I would (love you to the end of time)

I swore I would (love you to the end of time)

Ah, ah, ah

So now I'm praying for the end of time

To hurry up and arrive

'Cause if I gotta spend another minute with you

I don't think that I can really survive

I'll never break my promise or forget my vow

(But God only knows what I can do right now)

I'm praying for the end of time

It's all that I can do {All that I can do}

Prayin' for the end of time

So I can end my time with you! {You, yeah}

It was long ago and it was far away (It never felt so good, It never felt so right)

And it was so much better than it is today {Better than it is today} (And we were glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife)

It was long ago and it was far away (It never felt so good, It never felt so right)

And it was so much better than it is today {Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah}

(And we were glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife)

It was long ago and it was far away (It never felt so good, It never felt so right)

And it was so much better than it is today

{Long ago, oh} (And we were glowing like the metal)

Felt so right

Felt so good

Paradise (Ooh, yeah)

## Because You Loved Me  

For all those times you stood by me

For all the truth that you made me see

For all the joy you brought to my life

For all the wrong that you made right

For every dream you made come true

For all the love I found in you

I'll be forever thankful, baby

You're the one who held me up

Never let me fall

You're the one who saw me through, through it all

You were my strength when I was weak

You were my voice when I couldn't speak

You were my eyes when I couldn't see

You saw the best there was in me

Lifted me up when I couldn't reach

You gave me faith 'cause you believed

I'm everything I am

Because you loved me

Ooh, baby

You gave me wings and made me fly

You touched my hand, I could touch the sky

I lost my faith, you gave it back to me

You said no star was out of reach

You stood by me and I stood tall

I had your love, I had it all

I'm grateful for each day you gave me

Maybe I don't know that much

But I know this much is true

I was blessed because I was loved by you

You were my strength when I was weak (You were my strength)

You were my voice when I couldn't speak

You were my eyes when I couldn't see

You saw the best there was in me

Lifted me up when I couldn't reach

You gave me faith 'cause you believed

I'm everything I am

Because you loved me (Loved me), oh

You were always there for me

The tender wind that carried me

A light in the dark, shining your love into my life

You've been my inspiration

Through the lies, you were the truth

My world is a better place because of you

You were my strength when I was weak (You were my strength)

You were my voice when I couldn't speak (Oh, when I couldn't speak)

You were my eyes when I couldn't see

You saw the best there was in me

Lifted me up when I couldn't reach (Oh)

You gave me faith 'cause you believed

I'm everything I am

Because you loved me (Hey)

You were my strength when I was weak

You were my voice when I couldn't speak (My voice)

You were my eyes when I couldn't see

You saw the best there was in me

Lifted me up when I couldn't reach (Oh)

You gave me faith 'cause you believed (Believed)

I'm everything I am

Because you loved me

Oh

I'm everything I am

Because you loved me

## It's All Coming Back To Me Now  

There were nights when the wind was so cold

That my body froze in bed if I just listened to it

Right outside the window

There were days when the sun was so cruel

That all the tears turned to dust

And I just knew my eyes were drying up forever (Forever)

I finished crying in the instant that you left

And I can't remember where or when or how

And I banished every memory you and I had ever made

But when you touch me like this

And you hold me like that

I just have to admit

That it's all coming back to me

When I touch you like this

And I hold you like that

It's so hard to believe

But it's all coming back to me

(It's all coming back, it's all coming back to me now)

There were moments of gold

And there were flashes of light

There were things I'd never do again

But then they'd always seemed right

There were nights of endless pleasure

It was more than any laws allow

Baby, baby

If I kiss you like this

And if you whisper like that

It was lost long ago

But it's all coming back to me

If you want me like this

And if you need me like that

It was dead long ago

But it's all coming back to me

It's so hard to resist

And it's all coming back to me

I can barely recall

But it's all coming back to me now

But it's all coming back

There were those empty threats and hollow lies

And whenever you tried to hurt me

I just hurt you even worse, and so much deeper

There were hours that just went on for days

When alone at last we'd count up all the chances

That were lost to us forever (Forever)

But you were history with the slamming of the door

And I made myself so strong again somehow

And I never wasted any of my time on you since then

But if I touch you like this

And if you kiss me like that

It was so long ago

But it's all coming back to me

If you touch me like this

And if I kiss you like that

It was gone with the wind

But it's all coming back to me

(It's all coming back, it's all coming back to me now)

There were moments of gold

And there were flashes of light

There were things we'd never do again

But then they'd always seemed right

There were nights of endless pleasure

It was more than all your laws allow

Baby, baby, baby

When you touch me like this

And when you hold me like that

It was gone with the wind

But it's all coming back to me

When you see me like this

And when I see you like that

Then we see what we want to see

All coming back to me

The flesh and the fantasies

All coming back to me

I can barely recall

But it's all coming back to me now

If you forgive me all this

If I forgive you all that

We forgive and forget

And it's all coming back to me

When you see me like this

And when I see you like that

We see just what we want to see

All coming back to me

The flesh and the fantasies

All coming back to me

I can barely recall

But it's all coming back to me now

(It's all coming back to me now)

And when you kiss me like this

(It's all coming back to me now)

And when I touch you like that

(It's all coming back to me now)

And if you do it like this

(It's all coming back to me now)

And if we

## I Was Here  

I wanna leave my footprints on the sands of time

Know there was something that meant something that I left behind

When I leave this world, I'll leave no regrets

Leave something to remember, so they won't forget

I was here

I lived, I loved

I was here

I did, I've done everything that I wanted

And it was more than I thought it would be

I will leave my mark so everyone will know

I was here

I wanna say I lived each day until I die

And know that I meant something in somebody's life

The hearts I have touched will be the proof that I leave

That I made a difference, and this world will see

I was here

I lived, I loved

I was here

I did, I've done everything that I wanted

And it was more than I thought it would be

I will leave my mark so everyone will know

I was here

I lived, I loved

I was here

I did, I've done everything that I wanted

And it was more than I thought it would be

I will leave my mark so everyone will know

I was here

I just want them to know

That I gave my all, did my best

Brought someone some happiness

Left this world a little better just because

I was here

I was here

I lived, I loved

I was here

I did, I've done everything that I wanted

And it was more than I thought it would be

I wanna leave my mark so everyone will know

I was here

(Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na)

I lived (I lived), I loved

(Na-na-na-na, na-na-na)

I was here

(Na-na-na-na, na-na-na)

I was here (Oh)

(Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na)

I did, I've done

(Na-na-na-na, na-na-na)

I was here

## So Emotional  

I don't know why I like it, huh

I just do

Woo, ooh

Ooh

I've been hearin' your heartbeat inside of me

I keep your photo right beside my bed

Livin' in a world of fantasies

I can't get you out of my head, uh

I've been waiting for the phone to ring all night

Why you wanna make me feel so good?

I got a love of my own, babe

I shouldn't get so hung up on you

I remember the way that we touched

I wish I didn't like it so much

Ah, uh

I get so emotional, baby

Every time I think of you

I get so emotional, baby

Ain't it shocking what love can do?

Ain't it shocking what love can do?

Ain't it shocking what love can do? Hee

I gotta watch you walk in the room, baby

I gotta watch you walk out, yes, I do

I like the animal way you move

And when you talk, I just watch your mouth

Oh, I remember the way that we touched

I wish I didn't like it so much

Ooh

Every time I think of you

I get so emotional, baby

Ain't it shocking what love can do?

I get so emotional, baby

Every time I think of you

I get so emotional, baby

Ain't it shocking what love can do?

Ain't it shocking what love can do?

Ain't it shocking, love can do

Hee-hee

I wish I didn't like it so much

No, no, no

Every time I think of you (You know what I mean, hee, hee, hoo)

I get so emotional, baby (Hey, yeah, baby)

Shocking what love can do, ooh-ooh

## Cell Block Tango  

And now, the six merry murderesses of the Cook County Jail

In their rendition of 'The Cell Block Tango'!

Pop! Six! Squish! Uh uh! Cicero, Lipschitz!

Pop! Six! Squish! Uh uh! Cicero, Lipschitz!

Pop! Six! Squish! Uh uh! Cicero, Lipschitz!

Pop! Six! Squish! Uh uh! Cicero, Lipschitz!

He had it comin', he had it comin'

He only had himself to blame!

If you'd have been there, if you'd have seen it

I betcha you would have done the same!

Pop! Six! Squish! Uh uh! Cicero, Lipschitz!

You know how people have these little habits that get you down? Like Bernie! Bernie liked to chew gum--no, not chew. Pop!

Well, I come home this one day, and there's Bernie, layin' on the couch, chewin'--no, not chewin', poppin'!

So, I said to him, I said "Bernie, you pop that gum one more time…"

And he did. So I took the shotgun off the wall and I fired two warning shots

Into his head!

He had it comin', he had it comin'

He only had himself to blame!

I met Ezekiel Young from Salt Lake City about two years ago and he told me he was single and we uh, hit it off right away. So, we started livin' together. He'd go to work, he'd come home, I'd mix him a drink, we'd have dinner

Then I found out, single my ass! Not only was he married, well, he had six wives; one of them Mormons, you know?

So that night, when he came home, I mixed him his drink as usual

You know, some guys just can't hold their arsenic!

He had it comin', he had it comin' (Pop! Six! Squish! Uh-huh! Cicero, Lipschitz!)

He took a flower in its prime! (Pop! Six! Squish! Uh-huh! Cicero, Lipschitz!)

And then he used it (Pop!); and he abused it (Six!)

It was a murder, but not a crime! (Squish! Uh uh! Cicero, Lipschitz!)

Now, I'm standin' in the kitchen, carvin' up the chicken for dinner, and in storms my husband Wilbur in a jealous rage

"You been screwin' the milkman!" he said, and he kept sayin', "You been screwin' the milkman!"

Then he ran into my knife.

He ran into my knife ten times

If you'd have been there, if you'd have seen it

I betcha you would have done the same!

Mit keresek én itt? Azt mondják, a híres lakóm lefogta a férjem, én meg lecsaptam a fejét. De nem igaz. Én ártatlan vagyok. Nem tudom, miért mondja Uncle Sam, hogy én tettem. Próbáltam a rendőrségen megmagyarázni, de nem értették meg

But did you do it?

Uh uh, not guilty!

(He had it comin')

My sister Veronica and I did this double act (He had it comin')

And my husband Charlie traveled around with us. For the last number in our act, we did these twenty acrobatic tricks in a row (He only had himself to blame)

One, two, three, four, five, splits, spread eagles, flip flops, backflips, one right after the other! (If you'd have been there)

Well, this one night we were in Cicero, the three of us (If you'd have seen it)

And we were in this hotel room boozin' and havin' a few laughs. And we run out of ice, so I went out to get some (I betcha you would have done the same)

I come back, open the door…

There's Veronica and Charlie doin' number seventeen… the spread eagle! (He had it comin', he had it—)

Well, I was in such a state of shock, I completely blacked out. I can't remember a thing. It wasn't until later, when I was washin' the blood off my hands, I even knew they were dead!

They had it comin' (They had it comin'!), they had it comin'! (They had it comin'!)

They had it comin' all along! (They took a flower in its prime)

I didn't do it (And then they used it), but if I'd done it (And they abused it)

How could you tell me that I was wrong? (It was a murder, but not a crime)

(He had it comin')

I loved Alvin Lipschitz

He was a real artistic guy, sensitive, a painter (He had it comin')

But he was always trying to "find himself". He'd go out every night looking for himself (He only had himself to blame)

And on the way, he found Ruth, Gladys, Rosemary and Irving (If you'd have been there)

I guess you can say we broke up because of artistic differences (If you'd have seen it)

He saw himself as alive

And I saw him dead

The dirty bum, bum, bum, bum, bum!

The dirty bum, bum, bum, bum, bum!

They had it comin' (They had it comin'), they had it comin' (They had it comin')

They had it comin' all along! (They had it comin' all along)

'Cause if they used us ('Cause if they used us), and they abused us (And they abused us)

How could they tell us that we were wrong?

He had it comin' (He had it comin'), he had it comin' (He had it comin')

He only had himself to blame! (He only had himself to blame)

If you'd have been there (If you'd have been there), if you'd have seen it (If you'd have seen it)

I betcha you would have done the same

You pop that gum one more time--

Single my ass--

Ten times--

Miért csukott Uncle Sam börtönbe!

Number seventeen, the spread eagle!

Artistic differences—

I betcha you would have done the same!

## Take My Breath Away  

Watching every motion in my foolish lover's game

On this endless ocean, finally lovers know no shame

Turning and returning to some secret place inside

Watching in slow motion as you turn around and say

"Take my breath away"

"Take my breath away"

Watching, I keep waiting, still anticipating love

Never hesitating to become the fated ones

Turning and returning to some secret place to hide

Watching in slow motion as you turn to me and say

"My love, take my breath away"

Through the hourglass, I saw you

In time, you slipped away

When the mirror crashed I called you

And turned to hear you say

"If only for today, I am unafraid"

"Take my breath away"

"Take my breath away"

Watching every motion in this foolish lover's game

Haunted by the notion somewhere there's a love in flames

Turning and returning to some secret place inside

Watching in slow motion as you turn my way and say

"Take my breath away"

"My love, take my breath away"

"My love, take my breath away, my love"

"My love, take my breath away, my love"

"Take my breath away..."

## Home  

Another summer day has come and gone away

In Paris and Rome, but I wanna go home, mmm

Maybe surrounded by a million people, I

Still feel all alone

I just wanna go home

Oh, I miss you, you know

And I've been keeping all the letters that I wrote to you

Each one a line or two

"I'm fine, baby, how are you?"

Well, I would send them, but I know that it's just not enough

My words were cold and flat

And you deserve more than that

Another aeroplane, another sunny place

I'm lucky, I know, but I wanna go home

Mmm, I got to go home

Let me go home

I'm just too far from where you are

I wanna come home

And I feel just like I'm living someone else's life

It's like I just stepped outside

When everything was going right

And I know just why you could not come along with me

That this was not your dream

But you always believed in me

Another winter day has come and gone away

In either Paris or Rome, and I wanna go home

Let me go home

And I'm surrounded by a million people, I

I still feel alone

Oh, let me go home

Oh, I miss you, you know

Let me go home

I've had my run and baby, I'm done

I gotta go home

Let me go home

It'll all be alright

I'll be home tonight

I'm coming back home

## How Will I Know  

There's a boy I know, he's the one I dream of

Looks into my eyes, takes me to the clouds above

Ooh, I lose control, can't seem to get enough, uh-huh

When I wake from dreaming, tell me, is it really love?

Ooh, how will I know? (Don't trust your feelings)

How will I know?

How will I know? (Love can be deceiving)

How will I know?

How will I know if he really loves me?

I say a prayer with every heartbeat

I fall in love whenever we meet

I'm asking you 'cause you know about these things

How will I know if he's thinking of me?

I try to phone, but I'm too shy (Can't speak)

Falling in love is so bittersweet

This love is strong, why do I feel weak?

Oh, wake me, I'm shaking

Wish I had you near me now, uh-huh

Said there's no mistakin'

What I feel is really love

Ooh, tell me

How will I know? (Don't trust your feelings)

How will I know?

How will I know? (Love can be deceiving)

How will I know?

How will I know if he really loves me?

I say a prayer with every heartbeat

I fall in love whenever we meet

I'm asking you 'cause you know about these things

How will I know if he's thinking of me?

I try to phone, but I'm too shy (Can't speak)

Falling in love is so bittersweet

This love is strong, why do I feel weak?

If he loves me

If he loves me not (Mm)

If he loves me

(Ooh) If he loves me not

(Hey) If he loves me

If he loves me not

Oh, how will I know?

How will I know?

How will I know?

Hey, how will I know? (Ooh)

How will I know if he really loves me?

I say a prayer with every heartbeat

I fall in love whenever we meet

I'm asking you 'cause you know about these things

How will I know if he's thinking of me?

I try to phone, but I'm too shy (Can't speak)

Falling in love is so bittersweet

This love is strong, why do I feel weak?

How will I know? (How will I know?)

How will I know?

How will I know? (I say a prayer)

How will I know? Ooh

How will I know? (I fall in love)

How will I know?

Hey, how will I know?

I'm asking you

How will I, how will I know?

## Fighter  

Hm

After all you put me through

You'd think I'd despise you (Ooh)

But in the end, I wanna thank you

'Cause you made me that much stronger

Well, I, I thought I knew you

Thinkin' that you were true

Guess I, I couldn't trust, called your bluff

Time is up 'cause I've had enough

You were there by my side

Always down for the ride

But your joy ride just came down in flames

'Cause your greed sold me out in shame, mhm

After all of the stealing and cheating

You probably think that I hold resentment for you

But uh-uh, oh no, you're wrong

'Cause if it wasn't for all that you tried to do

I wouldn't know just how capable

I am to pull through

So I wanna say thank you, 'cause it

Makes me that much stronger

Makes me work a little bit harder

Makes me that much wiser

So thanks for making me a fighter

Made me learn a little bit faster

Made my skin a little bit thicker

Makes me that much smarter

So thanks for making me a fighter

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, yeah, yeah, oh

Never saw it coming

All of your backstabbing

Just so you could cash in on a good thing

Before I realized your game

I heard you're goin' 'round

Playin' the victim now

But don't even begin feeling I'm the one to blame

'Cause you dug your own grave

After all of the fights and the lies

Guess you're wanting to hold me

But that won't work anymore (No more, uh-huh, it's over)

'Cause if it wasn't for all of your torture

I wouldn't know how to be this way now and never back down

So I wanna say thank you, 'cause it

Makes me that much stronger

Makes me work a little bit harder

It makes me that much wiser

So thanks for making me a fighter

Made me learn a little bit faster

Made my skin a little bit thicker

Makes me that much smarter

So thanks for making me a fighter

How could this man I thought I knew

Turn out to be unjust, so cruel?

Could only see the good in you

Pretended not to see the truth

You tried to hide your lies, disguise yourself

Through living in denial

But in the end you'll see, you won't stop me

I am a fighter and I (I'm a fighter)

I ain't gon' stop (I ain't gonna stop)

There is no turning back

I've had enough

Makes me that much stronger

Makes me work a little bit harder (Oh)

It makes me that much wiser (Ooh yeah, ooh yeah)

So thanks for making me a fighter (Ha, a fighter)

Made me learn a little bit faster (Yeah)

Made my skin a little bit thicker (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Makes me that much smarter (Yeah)

So thanks for making me a fighter (Fighter)

You thought I would forget, thought I, I remember (Oh)

'Cause I remember (Oh)

I remember

You thought I would forget (Ooh-ooh)

I remember (Oh-ooh)

'Cause I remember (Oh)

I remember

Makes me that much stronger (Ooh-ooh)

Makes me work a little bit harder (Ooh-ooh)

It makes me that much wiser

So thanks for making me a fighter

Made me learn a little bit faster

Made my skin a little bit thicker

It makes me that much smarter

So thanks for making me a fighter

## Fly / I Believe I Can Fly  

I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive

I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise

To fly

To fly (Uh, yo, yo)

I used to think that I could not go on

I wish today it would rain all day

Maybe that will kinda make the pain go away

And life was nothing but an awful song

They got their guns out aiming at me

But I become Neo when they aiming at me (If I can see it)

Me, me, me against them

Me against enemies, me against friends (Then I can do it)

Somehow they both seem to become one

A sea full of sharks and they all smell blood (If I just believe it)

They start coming and I start rising

Must be surprising, I'm just surmising (There's nothing to it)

I win, thrive, soar

Higher, higher, higher

More fire

(I came to win), to fight, to conquer, to thrive

I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise

I believe I can fly (Fly)

I believe I can touch the sky

I believe I can fly (Fly)

I believe I can touch the sky

See, I was on the verge of breaking down

Paint they own pictures, then they crop me in

But I will remain where the top begins

Sometimes silence can seem so loud

I am not a word, I am not a line

I am not a girl that can ever be defined (If I can see it)

I hear the criticism loud and clear

That is how I know that the time is near (Then I can do it)

See we become alive in a time of fear

And I ain't got no motherfickle time to spare (If I just believe it)

Cry my eyes out for days upon days

Such a heavy burden placed upon me (There's nothing to it)

But when you go hard your nays become yays

Yankee Stadium with Jay's and Kanye's

(I came to win), to fight, to conquer, to thrive

I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise

I believe I can fly (Fly) {Fly}

I believe I can touch the sky {Ooh-ooh, uh, yeah}

I believe I can fly (Fly)

I believe I can touch the sky {Fly}

I believe I can fly (Fly)

(Get ready for it, get ready for it) Then I can be it

(Get ready for it, I came to win) If I just believe it

(Get ready for it, get ready for it) There's nothing to it

Get ready for it

I believe I can fly (Fly) {Ooh-ooh}

I believe I can touch the sky {Fly}

I think about it every night and day (Fly) {Oh}

Spread my wings and fly away {Ooh, whoa}

(I can fly) I believe I can soar (Fly) {Get ready for it}

(I can fly) I see me runnin' through that open door {Get ready for it, fly}

{I can fly} I believe I can fly (Fly) (Woo) (Get ready for it)

(New Directions: I can fly) I believe I can fly

I believe I can (Fly)

## Don't Speak  

You and me

We used to be together

Every day together, always

I really feel

That I'm losing my best friend

I can't believe this could be the end

It looks as though you're letting go

And if it's real, well, I don't want to know

Don't speak

I know just what you're sayin'

So please stop explainin'

Don't tell me 'cause it hurts

Don't speak

I know what you're thinkin'

I don't need your reasons

Don't tell me 'cause it hurts

Our memories

They can be inviting

But some are altogether mighty frightening

As we die, both you and I

With my head in my hands, I sit and cry

Don't speak

I know just what you're sayin'

So please stop explainin'

Don't tell me 'cause it hurts

No, no, no, don't speak

I know what you're thinkin'

And I don't need your reasons

Don't tell me 'cause it hurts

It's all ending

I gotta stop pretending

Who we are

You and me

I can see us dyin'

Are we?

Don't speak

I know just what you're sayin'

So please stop explainin'

Don't tell me 'cause it hurts

No, no, don't speak

I know what you're thinkin'

And I don't need your reasons

Don't tell me 'cause it hurts

Don't tell me 'cause it hurts

I know what you're sayin'

So please stop explainin'

Don't speak, don't speak

Don't speak, no

I know what you're thinkin'

And I don't need your reasons

I know you're good

I know you're good

I know you're real good, oh

La-la-la-la

La-la-la-la

Don't, don't

Ooh-ooh

Hush, hush, darlin'

Hush, hush, darlin'

Hush, hush

Don't tell me 'cause it hurts

Hush, hush, darlin'

Hush, hush, darlin'

Hush, hush

Don't tell me 'cause it hurts

Oh, hush, hush, darlin'

Hush, hush, darlin'

## Thank You  

My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I

Got out of bed at all

The morning rain clouds up my window

And I can't see at all

And even if I could, it'd all be grey

But your picture on my wall

It reminds me that it's not so bad

It's not so bad

I drank too much last night, got bills to pay

My head just feels in pain

I missed the bus and there'll be hell today

I'm late for work again

And even if I'm there, they'll all imply

That I might not last the day

And then you call me and it's not so bad

It's not so bad

And I want to thank you

For giving me the best day of my life

And oh, just to be with you

Is having the best day of my life

Push the door, I'm home at last

And I'm soaking through and through

And then you handed me a towel

And all I see is you

And even if my house falls down now

I wouldn't have a clue

Because you're near me

And I want to thank you

For giving me the best day of my life

And oh, just to be with you

Is having the best day of my life

And I want to thank you

For giving me the best day of my life

And oh, just to be with you

Is having the best day of my life

## Mean  

You, with your words like knives

And swords and weapons that you use against me

You, have knocked me off my feet again

Got me feeling like I'm nothing

You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard

Calling me out when I'm wounded

You, pickin' on the weaker man

Well you can take me down

With just one single blow

But you don't know, what you don't know

Someday, I'll be living in a big old city

And all you're ever gonna be is mean

Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me

And all you're ever gonna be is mean

Why you gotta be so mean?

You, with your switching sides

And your wildfire lies and your humiliation

You, have pointed out my flaws again

As if I don't already see them

I walk with my head down

Trying to block you out

'Cause I'll never impress you

I just wanna feel okay again

I bet you got pushed around

Somebody made you cold

But the cycle ends right now

Cause you can't lead me down that road

You don't know, what you don't know

Someday, I'll be, living in a big old city

And all you're ever gonna be is mean

Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me

And all you're ever gonna be is mean

Why you gotta be so mean?

And I can see you years from now in a bar

Talking over a football game

With that same big loud opinion but

Nobody's listening

Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things

Drunk and grumbling on about how I can't sing

But all you are is mean

All you are is mean

And a liar, and pathetic, and alone in life, and mean

And mean, and mean, and mean

But someday, I'll be, living in a big old city

And all you're ever gonna be is mean. Yeah

Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me

And all you're ever gonna be is mean

Why you gotta be so mean? (Someday, I'll be, living in a big old city)

Why you gotta be so mean? (And all you're ever gonna be is mean)

Why you gotta be so mean? (Someday, I'll be living in a big old city)

Why you gotta be so mean?

And all you're ever gonna be is mean

Why you gotta be so mean?

## Hurt  

Seems like it was yesterday when I saw your face

You told me how proud you were, but I walked away

If only I knew what I know today

Ooh, ooh

I would hold you in my arms

I would take the pain away

Thank you for all you've done

Forgive all your mistakes

There's nothing I wouldn't do

To hear your voice again

Sometimes I wanna call you

But I know you won't be there

Oh, I'm sorry for blaming you

For everything I just couldn't do

And I've hurt myself by hurting you

Some days I feel broke inside, but I won't admit

Sometimes I just wanna hide 'cause it's you I miss

And it's so hard to say goodbye when it comes to this

Ooh, ooh, ah

Would you tell me I was wrong?

Would you help me understand?

Are you lookin' down upon me?

Are you proud of who I am?

There's nothing I wouldn't do

To have just one more chance

To look into your eyes

And see you looking back

Oh, I'm sorry for blaming you

For everything I just couldn't do

And I've hurt myself

Oh, oh

If I had just one more day

I would tell you how much that I've missed you since you've been away

Oh, it's dangerous

It's so out of line

To try and turn back time

I'm sorry for blaming you

For everything I just couldn't do

And I've hurt myself

By hurting you

## The Code  

Woah-oh-oh

Welcome to the show, let everybody know

I'm done playin' the game, I'll break out of the chains

You better buckle up, I'll pour another cup

This is my bohème, so drink it up, my friend

Oh

Oh

This story is my truth

I, I went to hell and back

To find myself on track

I broke the code, woah-oh-oh

Like ammonites

I just gave it some time

Now I found paradise

I broke the code, woah-oh-oh (Yeah)

Let me tell you a tale about life

'Bout the good and the bad, better hold on tight

Who decides what's wrong, what's right?

Everything is balance, everything's light

I got so much on my mind

And I been awake all night

I'm so pumped, I'm so psyched

It's bigger than me, I'm gettin' so hyped, like

(Oh) Let me taste the lows and highs

(Oh) Let me feel that burning fright

(Oh) This story is my truth

I, I went to hell and back

To find myself on track

I broke the code, woah-oh-oh

Like ammonites

I just gave it some time

Now I found paradise

I broke the code, woah-oh-oh (Ooh)

Somewhere between the O's and ones

That's where I found my kingdom come

My heart beats like a—

Somewhere between the O's and ones

That's where I found my kingdom come

My heart beats like a drum

(Ooh, ooh-ooh)

(Ooh, ooh)

(Ooh, ooh-ooh)

(Ooh, ooh)

I, I went to hell and back

To find myself on track

I broke the code, woah-oh-oh

Like ammonites

I just gave it some time

Now I found paradise

I broke the code, woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh

## Listen to Your Heart  

I know there's something in the wake of your smile

I get a notion from the look in your eyes, yeah

You've built a love, but that love falls apart

Your little piece of Heaven turns too dark

Listen to your heart

When he's calling for you

Listen to your heart

There's nothing else you can do

I don't know where you're going

And I don't know why

But listen to your heart

Before you tell him goodbye

Sometimes you wonder if this fight is worthwhile

The precious moments are all lost in the tide, yeah

They're swept away, and nothing is what is seems

The feeling of belonging to your dreams

Listen to your heart

When he's calling for you

Listen to your heart

There's nothing else you can do

I don't know where you're going

And I don't know why

But listen to your heart

Before you tell him goodbye

And there are voices that want to be heard

So much to mention but you can't find the words

The scent of magic, the beauty that's been

When love was wilder than the wind

Listen to your heart (Take a listen to it)

When he's calling for you

Listen to your heart (Take a listen to it)

There's nothing else you can do

I don't know where you're going

And I don't know why

But listen to your heart before, uhh

Listen to your heart (Take a listen to it)

When he's calling for you

Listen to your heart (Take a listen to it)

There's nothing else you can do

I don't know where you're going

And I don't know why

But listen to your heart

Before you tell him goodbye

Listen to your heart

Listen to your heart (Uhh, take a listen to it, ha-ha-aa)

Listen to your heart (Take a, take a listen to it)

Listen to your heart

Listen to your heart

Listen to your heart

Listen to your heart

Listen to your heart

Listen to your heart

Listen to your heart

Listen to your heart

## The Reason  

I'm not a perfect person

There's many things I wish I didn't do

But I continue learning

I never meant to do those things to you

And so I have to say before I go

That I just want you to know

I've found a reason for me

To change who I used to be

A reason to start over new

And the reason is you

I'm sorry that I hurt you

It's something I must live with every day

And all the pain I put you through

I wish that I could take it all away

And be the one who catches all your tears

That's why I need you to hear

I've found a reason for me

To change who I used to be

A reason to start over new

And the reason is you

And the reason is you

And the reason is you

And the reason is you

I'm not a perfect person

I never meant to do those things to you

And so I have to say before I go

That I just want you to know

I've found a reason for me

To change who I used to be

A reason to start over new

And the reason is you

I've found a reason to show

A side of me you didn't know

A reason for all that I do

And the reason is you

## Rolling in the Deep  

There's a fire starting in my heart

Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark

Finally, I can see you crystal clear

Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare

See how I'll leave with every piece of you

Don't underestimate the things that I will do

There's a fire starting in my heart

Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark

The scars of your love remind me of us

They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all

The scars of your love, they leave me breathless

I can't help feeling

We could've had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me)

Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you never had met me)

And you played it to the beat (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Baby, I have no story to be told

But I've heard one on you, now I'm gonna make your head burn

Think of me in the depths of your despair

Make a home down there, as mine sure won't be shared

(You're gonna wish you never had met me) The scars of your love remind me of us

(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all

(You're gonna wish you never had met me) The scars of your love, they leave me breathless

(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) I can't help feeling

We could've had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me)

Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you never had met me)

And you played it to the beat (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Could've had it all

Rolling in the deep

You had my heart inside of your hand

But you played it with a beating

Throw your soul through every open door (Ooh woah, oh)

Count your blessings to find what you look for (Woah)

Turn my sorrow into treasured gold (Ooh woah, oh)

You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you've sown

(You're gonna wish you never had met me)

We could've had it all (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

We could've had it all, yeah (You're gonna wish you never had met me)

It all, it all, it all (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

We could've had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me)

Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you never had met me)

And you played it to the beat (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Could've had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me)

Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you never had met me)

But you played it, you played it, you played it

You played it to the beat

## Cry  

If anyone asks

I'll tell them we both just moved on

When people all stare

I'll pretend that I don't hear them talk

Whenever I see you

I'll swallow my pride

And bite my tongue

Pretend I'm okay with it all

Act like there's nothing wrong

Is it over yet?

Can I open my eyes?

Is this as hard as it gets?

Is this what it feels like to really cry?

Cry!

If anyone asks

I'll tell them we just grew apart (Tell them we just grew apart)

And what do I care

If they believe me or not (They believe me or not)

Whenever I feel

Your memory is breaking my heart

I'll pretend I'm okay with it all

Act like there's nothing wrong

Is it over yet?

Can I open my eyes?

Is this as hard as it gets?

Is this what it feels like to really cry?

Cry!

I'm talking in circles

I'm lying, they know it

Why won't this just all go...

...Away!

Is it over yet?

Can I open my eyes?

Is this as hard as it gets?

Is this what it feels like to really cry?

Cry!

Cry!

## Shallow  

Tell me somethin', girl

Are you happy in this modern world?

Or do you need more?

Is there somethin' else you're searchin' for?

I'm fallin'

In all the good times, I find myself longin'

For change

And, in the bad times, I fear myself

Tell me something, boy

Aren't you tired tryna fill that void?

Or do you need more?

Ain't it hard keepin' it so hardcore?

I'm falling

In all the good times, I find myself longing

For change

And, in the bad times, I fear myself

I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in

I'll never meet the ground

Crash through the surface where they can't hurt us

We're far from the shallow now

In the sha-ha, sha-hallow

In the sha-ha, sha-la-la-la-low

In the sha-ha, sha-hallow

We're far from the shallow now

Oh, ha, ah, ha

Oh-ah, ha

I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in

I'll never meet the ground

Crash through the surface where they can't hurt us

We're far from the shallow now

In the sha-ha, shallow

In the sha-ha, sha-la-la-la-low

In the sha-ha, shallow

We're far from the shallow now

## OWN MY MIND  

Well, I don't know your secrets, I'm no visionary

Yeah, I don't know your story but I like what I see

So, tell me what you've been missing

I'll do anything to get you ticking

And you might be the answer to the sinner in me

Oh, it's automatic

You know I just gotta have it

I'll make your body a habit

You know there's some kind of magic, uh-huh

And do you wanna, do you wanna own my mind, own my mind?

Do you wanna, do you wanna all the time, all the time?

Do you wanna know what the good good bad things all feel like?

Yeah, do you wanna, do you wanna own my mind, own my mind?

Own my mind, own my mind

Own my mind, own my mind

Do you wanna know what the good good bad things all feel like?

Do you wanna, do you wanna own my mind, own my mind?

In my civilization, you're the king and the queen

I'm prayin' at your altar if you know what I mean

Yeah, everything I've been missin'

You've been servin' up in your kitchen

No, I'm not even superstitious

But I'm feelin' you're something vicious, yeah

It's automatic

You know I just gotta have it

I'll make your body a habit

You know there's some kind of magic, uh-huh

And do you wanna, do you wanna own my mind, own my mind?

Do you wanna, do you wanna all the time, all the time?

Do you wanna know what the good good bad things all feel like?

Yeah, do you wanna, do you wanna own my mind, own my mind?

Own my mind, own my mind

Own my mind, own my mind

Do you wanna know what the good good bad things all feel like?

Do you wanna, do you wanna own my mind, own my mind?

Do you want a long night?

Do you wanna be mine?

Do you wanna go once, go twice? Girl

Do you want a long night?

Do you wanna be mine?

Do you wanna go once, go twice? Girl

Do you wanna, do you wanna own my mind, own my mind?

Do you wanna, do you wanna own my mind, own my mind?

Do you wanna know what the good good bad things all feel like?

Do you wanna, do you wanna own my mind, own my mind?

## Mystery of Love  

Oh, to see without my eyes

The first time that you kissed me

Boundless by the time I cried

I built your walls around me

White noise, what an awful sound

Fumbling by Rogue River

Feel my feet above the ground

Hand of God, deliver me

Oh, oh woe-oh-woah is me

The first time that you touched me

Oh, will wonders ever cease?

Blessed be the mystery of love

Lord, I no longer believe

Drowned in living waters

Cursed by the love that I received

From my brother's daughter

Like Hephaestion, who died

Alexander's lover

Now my riverbed has dried

Shall I find no other?

Oh, oh woe-oh-woah is me

I'm running like a plover

Now I'm prone to misery

The birthmark on your shoulder reminds me

How much sorrow can I take?

Blackbird on my shoulder

And what difference does it make

When this love is over?

Shall I sleep within your bed?

River of unhappiness

Hold your hands upon my head

Till I breathe my last breath

Oh, oh woe-oh-woah is me

The last time that you touched me

Oh, will wonders ever cease?

Blessed be the mystery of love

## Futile Devices  

It's been a long, long time since I've memorized your face

It's been four hours now since I've wandered through your place

And when I sleep on your couch, I feel very safe

And when you bring the blankets, I cover up my face

I do love you

I do, ooh-ooh, love you

And when you play guitar, I listen to the strings buzz

The metal vibrates underneath your fingers

And when you crochet, I feel mesmerized and proud

And I would say I love you, but saying it out loud is hard

So I won't say it at all

And I won't stay very long

But you are the life I needed all along

I think of you as my brother

Although that sounds dumb

And words are futile devices

## Visions of Gideon  

I have loved you for the last time

Is it a video? Is it a video?

I have touched you for the last time

Is it a video? Is it a video?

For the love, for laughter, I flew up to your arms

Is it a video? Is it a video?

For the love, for laughter, I flew up to your arms

Is it a video? Is it a video?

Is it a video?

I have loved you for the last time

Visions of Gideon, visions of Gideon

And I have kissed you for the last time

Visions of Gideon, visions of Gideon

For the love, for laughter, I flew up to your arms

Is it a video? (Is it a video?) Is it a video? (Is it a video?)

For the love, for laughter, I flew up to your arms

Is it a video? (Is it a video?) Is it a video? (Is it a video?)

For the love, for laughter, I flew up to your arms

Visions of Gideon, (visions of Gideon), visions of Gideon, (visions of Gideon)

For the love, for laughter, I flew up to your arms

Visions of Gideon, (visions of Gideon), visions of Gideon, (visions of Gideon), Visions of Gideon

Visions of Gideon, visions of Gideon, visions of Gideon

Visions of Gideon, visions of Gideon, visions of Gideon

Visions of Gideon, (Is it a video?), visions of Gideon, (Is it a video?), visions of Gideon

Visions of Gideon, (Is it a video?), visions of Gideon, (Is it a video?), visions of Gideon

(Is it a video?) (Is it a video?) (Is it a video?)

## Encostar na Tua  

Eu quero te roubar pra mim

Eu, que não sei pedir nada

Meu caminho é meio perdido

Mas que perder seja o melhor destino

Agora não vou mais mudar

Minha procura por si só

Já era o que eu queria achar

Quando você chamar meu nome

Eu, que também não sei aonde estou

Pra mim que tudo era saudade

Agora seja lá o que for...

Eu só quero saber em qual rua

Minha vida vai encostar na tua...

Eu só quero saber em qual rua

Minha vida vai encostar na tua...

Eu quero te roubar pra mim

Eu, que não sei pedir nada

Meu caminho é meio perdido

Mas que perder seja o melhor destino

Agora não vou mais mudar

Minha procura por si só

Já era o que eu queria achar

Quando você chamar meu nome

Eu, que também não sei aonde estou

Pra mim que tudo era saudade

Agora seja lá o que for...

Eu só quero saber em qual rua

Minha vida vai encostar na tua...

Eu só quero saber em qual rua

Minha vida vai encostar na tua...

E saiba que forte eu sei chegar

Mesmo se eu perder o rumo, yeah!

E saiba que forte eu sei chegar

Se for preciso eu sumo...

Eu só quero saber em qual rua

Minha vida vai encostar na tua...

Eu só quero saber em qual rua

Minha vida vai encostar na tua...

Eu quero te roubar pra mim...

## Você me faz tão bem  

Quando eu me perco é quando eu te encontro

Quando eu me solto seus olhos me veem

Quando eu me iludo é quando eu te esqueço

Quando eu te tenho eu me sinto tão bem

Você me fez sentir de novo o que eu

Já não me importava mais

Você me faz tão bem

Você me faz, você me faz tão bem

Quando eu te invado de silêncio

Você conforta a minha dor com atenção

E quando eu durmo no seu colo

Você me faz sentir de novo

O que eu já não sentia mais

Você me faz tão bem

Você me faz, você me faz tão bem

Você me faz, você me faz tão bem

Você me faz, você me faz tão bem

Não tenha medo

Não tenha medo desse amor

Não faz sentido

Não faz sentido não mudar

Esse amor

Você me faz, você me faz tão bem

Você me faz, você me faz tão bem

Você me faz, você me faz tão bem

Você me faz, você me faz tão bem

## Outro Lugar  

'Inda vou te levar pra outro lugar

Além do sol, do mar

Aonde eu possa te ter, te amar

E o tempo vai ser maior

Não te quero assim tão longe

Tanto, quanto o céu do mar

Quero ter você mais perto

Certo, pronto pra te amar

'Inda vou te levar pra outro lugar

Além do sol, do mar

Aonde eu possa te ter, te amar

E o tempo vai ser maior

Quero ter o teu encanto

Tanto, pra me enfeitiçar

Quero ter você mais... perto

Pra poder te amar

Eu podia até tentar acreditar nessa ilusão

Não sei porquê, viagem errada então

O meu caminho me levava a acreditar que eu tava certo

Que eu era esperto e coisa e tal

Cara sinistro da zona sul

Andando com um monte de santinha pra lá e pra cá

Mas com você foi diferente, foi de primeira, quando eu te vi até me faltou ar

As oportunidades desta vida me fazem crer

Que quando estamos frente a frente, só eu e você

O tempo passa, tudo é mais fácil

Difícil é esquecer o que eu faço quando você se vai

Eu fico aqui bolando planos mirabolantes

Fico inconstante, pareço iniciante

Eu vou fazer de tudo pra trazer você pra perto de mim

Pode acreditar que sim

'Inda vou te levar pra outro lugar

Além do sol, do mar

Aonde eu possa te ter, te amar

E o tempo vai ser maior

'Inda vou te levar pra outro lugar

Além do sol, do mar

Aonde eu possa te ter, te amar

E o tempo vai ser maior

## Sutilmente  

E quando eu estiver triste

Simplesmente me abrace

Quando eu estiver louco

Subitamente se afaste

Quando eu estiver fogo

Suavemente se encaixe

E quando eu estiver triste

Simplesmente me abrace

E quando eu estiver louco

Subitamente se afaste

E quando eu estiver bobo

Sutilmente disfarce

Mas quando eu estiver morto

Suplico que não me mate, não

Dentro de ti, dentro de ti

Mesmo que o mundo acabe, enfim

Dentro de tudo que cabe em ti

## Resposta  

Bem mais que o tempo

Que nós perdemos

Ficou pra trás também o que nos juntou

Ainda lembro o que eu estava lendo

Só pra saber o que você achou

Dos versos que eu fiz

E ainda espero resposta

Desfaz o vento

O que há por dentro

Desse lugar que ninguém mais pisou

Você está vendo o que está acontecendo

Nesse caderno sei que ainda estão

Os versos seus

Tão meus que peço

Nos versos meus

Tão seus que esperem

Que os aceite

Em paz

Eu digo que eu sou

O antigo do que vai

Adiante

Sem mais eu fico onde estou

Prefiro continuar distante

Bem mais que o tempo

Que nós perdemos

Ficou pra trás também o que nos juntou

Ainda lembro o que eu estava lendo

Só pra saber o que você achou

Dos versos seus

Tão meus que peço

Nos versos meus

Tão seus que esperem

Que os aceite

Em paz

Eu digo que eu sou

O antigo do que vai

Adiante

Sem mais eu fico onde estou

Prefiro continuar distante

Em paz

Eu digo que eu sou

O antigo do que vai

Adiante

Sem mais eu fico onde estou

Prefiro continuar distante

Desfaz o vento

O que há por dentro

Desse lugar que ninguém mais pisou

Você está vendo o que está acontecendo

Nesse caderno sei que ainda estão

Os versos seus

Tão meus que peço

Nos versos meus

Tão seus que esperem

Sem mais eu fico onde estou

Prefiro continuar distante

E em paz

Eu digo que eu sou

O antigo do que vai

Adiante

Sem mais eu fico onde estou

Prefiro continuar distante

## Outra Vida  

Talvez não seja nessa vida ainda

Mas você ainda vai ser a minha vida

Então, a gente vai fugir pro mar

Eu vou pedir pra namorar

Você vai me dizer que vai pensar

Mas, no fim, vai beijar

Talvez não seja nessa vida ainda

Mas você ainda vai ser a minha vida

Sem ter mais mentiras pra me ver

Sem amor antigo pra esquecer

Sem os teus amigos pra esconder

Pode crer que tudo vai dar certo

Uebaruê-iô

Sou pescador, sonhador

Vou dizer pra Deus, nosso Senhor

Que tu és o amor da minha vida

Pois não dá pra viver nessa vida morendo de amor, o-iô

Talvez não seja nessa vida ainda

Mas você ainda vai ser a minha vida

E uma abelinha vai fazer o mel

Estrela d'alva vai pintar o céu

O vento certo vai soprar no mar

E pode crer que tudo vai dar certo

Uebaruê-iô

Sou pescador, sonhador

Vou dizer pra Deus, nosso Senhor

Que tu és o amor da minha vida

Pois não dá pra viver nessa vida morendo de amor

Uebaruê iô

Sou pescador, sonhador

Vou dizer pra Deus, nosso Senhor

Que tu és o amor da minha vida

Pois não dá pra viver nessa vida morrendo de amor

Uebaruê-iô

Uebaruê-iô

Uebaiô, o-ô

Você acredita em uma outra vida, só nós dois?

Pode crer que tudo vai dar certo

## Sem resposta  

Tire um pouco o peso

Das minhas costas

Falta pouco tempo

Prá eu ir embora

E eu nem sei se vou voltar...

Trilhe seu caminho

Faça suas apostas

Mas não me deixe aqui

Sozinha sem respostas

Que eu nem sei

Onde encontrar...

Eu sou apenas

Uma criança indefesa

Você parece

Uma caixinha de surpresas

Se for assim meu bem

Adeus!...

Não tô te pedindo prá ficar

E não vou te encher

De promessas

Eu te quero bem

Mas no amor eu tenho pressa...

Vá se acostumando

Com a minha ausencia

Faça logo as pazes

Com a sua consciência

E veja se você errou...

Trilhe seu caminho

Faça suas apostas

Mas não me deixe aqui

Buscando as respostas

Que Você nunca encontrou...

Eu sou apenas

Uma criança indefesa

Você pareceUma caixinha de surpresas

Se for assim meu bem

Adeus!...

Não tô te pedindo prá ficar

E não vou te encher

De promessas

Eu te quero bem

Mas no amor eu tenho pressa...(2x)

Eu sou apenas

Uma criança indefesa, ahan!

Você pareceUma caixinha de surpresas

Se for assim meu bem

Adeus!...

Não tô te pedindo prá ficar

E não vou te encher

De promessasEu te quero bem

Mas no amor eu tenho pressa...(2x)

Eu te quero bem

Mas no amor eu tenho pressa...

## Tô nem aí  

De mãos atadas, de pés descalços

Com você meu mundo andava de pernas pro ar

Sempre armada, segui seus passos

Atei seus braços pra você não me abandonar

Já nem lembro seu nome

Seu telefone eu fiz questão de apagar

Aceitei os meus erros, me reinventei e virei a página

Agora eu tô em outra

Tô nem aí, tô nem aí

Pode ficar com seu mundinho

Eu não tô nem aí

Tô nem aí, tô nem aí

Não vem falar dos seus problemas

Que eu não vou ouvir

Boca fechada, sem embaraços

Eu te dei todas as chances de ser um bom rapaz

Mas fui vencida pelo cansaço

Nosso amor foi enterrado e descansa em paz

Já nem lembro seu nome

Seu telefone eu fiz questão de apagar

Aceitei os meus erros, me reinventei e virei a página

Agora eu tô em outra

Tô nem aí, tô nem aí

Pode ficar com seu mundinho

Eu não tô nem aí

Tô nem aí, tô nem aí

Não vem falar dos seus problemas

Que eu não vou ouvir

Tô nem aí, tô nem aí

Pode ficar com seu mundinho

Eu não to nem aí

Tô nem aí, tô nem aí

Não vem falar dos seus problemas

Que eu não vou ouvir

## Amanhã não se sabe  

Como as folhas com o vento

Até onde vai dar o firmamento

Toda hora enquanto é tempo

Vivo aqui este momento

Hoje aqui amanhã não se sabe

Vivo agora antes que o dia acabe

Este instante nunca é tarde

Mal começou eu já estou com saudade

Me abraça, me aceita

Me aceita assim meu amor

Me abraça, me beija

Me aceita assim como eu sou

E deixa ser o que for

Como as ondas com a maré

Até onde não vai dar mais pé

Este instante tal qual é

Vivo aqui e seja o que Deus quiser

Hoje aqui não importa pra onde vamos

Vivo agora não tenho outros planos

E é tão fácil viver sonhando

Enquanto isso a vida vai passando

Me abraça, me aceita

Me aceita assim meu amor

Me abraça, me beija

Me aceita assim como eu sou

E deixa ser o que for

## White Flag  

I know you think that I shouldn't still love you

I'll tell you that

But if I didn't say it, well, I'd still have felt it

Where's the sense in that?

I promise I'm not trying to make your life harder

Or return to where we were

But I will go down with this ship

And I won't put my hands up and surrender

There will be no white flag above my door

I'm in love and always will be

I know I left too much mess and destruction

To come back again

And I caused nothing but trouble

I understand if you can't talk to me again

And if you live by the rules of "it's over"

Then I'm sure that that makes sense

But I will go down with this ship

And I won't put my hands up and surrender

There will be no white flag above my door

I'm in love and always will be

And when we meet

Which I'm sure we will

All that was there

Will be there still

I'll let it pass

And hold my tongue

And you will think

That I've moved on

I will go down with this ship

And I won't put my hands up and surrender

There will be no white flag above my door

I'm in love and always will be

I will go down with this ship

And I won't put my hands up and surrender

There will be no white flag above my door

I'm in love and always will be

I will go down with this ship

And I won't put my hands up and surrender

There will be no white flag above my door

I'm in love and always will be

## Here With Me  

I didn't hear you leave

I wonder, "How am I still here?"

And I don't wanna move a thing

It might change my memory

Oh, I am what I am

I'll do what I want

But I can't hide

And I won't go

I won't sleep

I can't breathe

Until you're resting here with me

And I won't leave

And I can't hide

I cannot be

Until you're resting here with me

I don't wanna call my friends

For they might wake me from this dream

And I can't leave this bed

Risk forgetting all that's been

Oh, I am what I am

I'll do what I want

But I can't hide

And I won't go

I won't sleep

And I can't breathe

Until you're resting here with me

And I won't leave

And I can't hide

I cannot be

Until you're resting here

And I won't go

And I won't sleep

And I can't breathe

Until you're resting here with me

And I won't leave

And I can't hide

I cannot be

Until you're resting here with me

Oh, I am what I am

I'll do what I want

But I can't hide

And I won't go

I won't sleep

And I can't breathe

Until you're resting here with me

And I won't leave

And I can't hide

I cannot be

Until you're resting here

And I won't go

And I won't sleep

And I can't breathe

Until you're resting here with me

And I won't leave

And I can't hide

I cannot be

Until you're resting here with me

## My Lover's Gone  

My lover's gone

His boots no longer by my door

He left at dawn

And as I slept, I felt him go

Returns no more

I will not watch the ocean

My lover's gone

No earthly ships will ever bring him home again

Bring him home again

My lover's gone

I know that kiss will be my last

No more his song

The tune upon his lips has passed

I sing alone

While I watch the ocean

My lover's gone

No earthly ships will ever bring him home again

Bring him home again

My lover's gone

His boots no longer by my door

He left at dawn

And as I slept, I felt him go

Returns no more

I will not watch the ocean

My lover's gone

No earthly ships will ever bring him home again

Bring him home again

## I Don't Want to Miss a Thing  

I could stay awake just to hear you breathin'

Watch you smile while you are sleepin'

While you're far away and dreamin'

I could spend my life in this sweet surrender

I could stay lost in this moment forever

Well, every moment spent with you is a moment I treasure

Don't wanna close my eyes

I don't wanna fall asleep

'Cause I'd miss you, babe

And I don't wanna miss a thing

'Cause even when I dream of you (Even when I dream)

The sweetest dream would never do

I'd still miss you, babe

And I don't wanna miss a thing

Lyin' close to you, feelin' your heart beatin'

And I'm wonderin' what you're dreamin'

Wonderin' if it's me you're seein'

Then I kiss your eyes and thank God we're together

And I just wanna stay with you in this moment forever

Forever and ever

I don't wanna close my eyes

I don't wanna fall asleep

'Cause I'd miss you, babe

And I don't wanna miss a thing

'Cause even when I dream of you (Even when I dream)

The sweetest dream would never do

I'd still miss you, babe

And I don't wanna miss a thing

I don't wanna miss one smile

I don't wanna miss one kiss

Well, I just wanna be with you

Right here with you, just like this

I just wanna hold you close

I feel your heart so close to mine

And just stay here in this moment

For all the rest of time

Yeah, yeah, yeah

Don't wanna close my eyes

Don't wanna fall asleep

'Cause I'd miss you, babe

And I don't wanna miss a thing

'Cause even when I dream of you

The sweetest dream would never do

I'd still miss you, babe

And I don't wanna miss a thing

I don't wanna close my eyes

I don't wanna fall asleep

'Cause I'd miss you, babe

And I don't wanna miss a thing

'Cause even when I dream of you

The sweetest dream would never do

I'd still miss you, babe

And I don't wanna miss a thing

Don't wanna close my eyes

I don't wanna fall asleep, yeah

I don't wanna miss a thing

## Same Mistake  

Saw the world turning in my sheets

And once again, I cannot sleep

Walk out the door and up the street

Look at the stars beneath my feet

Remember rights that I did wrong

So here I go

Oh ooh-

Oh ooh-

Oh ooh-

Hello, hello. There is no place I cannot go

My mind is muddy but my heart is heavy. Does it show?

I lose the track that loses me, so here I go

Oh ooh-

Oh ooh-

Oh ooh-

And so I sent some men to fight, and one came back at dead of night

Said he'd seen my enemy. Said he looked just like me

So I set out to cut myself and here I go

Oh ooh-

Oh ooh-

Oh ooh-

I'm not calling for a second chance

I'm screaming at the top of my voice

Give me reason, but don't give me choice

Cause I'll just make the same mistake again

Oh ooh-

And maybe someday we will meet

And maybe talk, and not just speak

Don't buy the promises, cause

There are no promises I keep

And my reflection troubles me

So here I go

Ah ooh-

Ah ooh-

Ah ooh-

I'm not calling for a second chance

I'm screaming at the top of my voice

Give me reason, but don't give me choice

Cause I'll just make the same mistake

I'm not calling for a second chance

I'm screaming at the top of my voice

Give me reason, but don't give me choice

Cause I'll just make the same mistake again

Ah ooh-

Ah ooh-

Ah ooh-

Ah ooh-

Saw the world turning in my sheets (Ah ooh-)

And once again, I cannot sleep (Ah ooh-)

Walk out the door and up the street (Ah ooh-)

Look at the stars (Ah ooh-)

Look at the stars fall down (Ah ooh-)

And wonder where (Ah ooh-)

Did I go wrong?

## Take My Breath Away  

Watching every motion in my foolish lover's game

On this endless ocean, finally lovers know no shame

Turning and returning to some secret place inside

Watching in slow motion as you turn around and say

"Take my breath away"

"Take my breath away"

Watching, I keep waiting, still anticipating love

Never hesitating to become the fated ones

Turning and returning to some secret place to hide

Watching in slow motion as you turn to me and say

"My love, take my breath away"

Through the hourglass, I saw you

In time, you slipped away

When the mirror crashed I called you

And turned to hear you say

"If only for today, I am unafraid"

"Take my breath away"

"Take my breath away"

Watching every motion in this foolish lover's game

Haunted by the notion somewhere there's a love in flames

Turning and returning to some secret place inside

Watching in slow motion as you turn my way and say

"Take my breath away"

"My love, take my breath away"

"My love, take my breath away, my love"

"My love, take my breath away, my love"

"Take my breath away..."

## Right Here Waiting  

Oceans apart, day after day

And I slowly go insane

I hear your voice on the line

But it doesn't stop the pain

If I see you next to never

Then how can we say forever?

Wherever you go, whatever you do

I will be right here waiting for you

Whatever it takes or how my heart breaks

I will be right here waiting for you

I took for granted, all the times

That I thought would last somehow

I hear the laughter, I taste the tears

But I can't get near you now

Oh, can't you see it, baby

You've got me going crazy

Wherever you go, whatever you do

I will be right here waiting for you

Whatever it takes or how my heart breaks

I will be right here waiting for you

I wonder how we can survive

This romance

But in the end if I'm with you

I'll take the chance

Oh, can't you see it, baby

You've got me going crazy

Wherever you go, whatever you do

I will be right here waiting for you

Whatever it takes or how my heart breaks

I will be right here waiting for you

Waiting for you

## I Just Called To Say I Love You  

No New Year's Day to celebrate

No chocolate-covered candy hearts to give away

No first of spring, no song to sing

In fact, here's just another ordinary day

No April rain, no flowers bloom

No wedding Saturday within the month of June

But what it is, it's something true

Made up of these three words that I must say to you

I just called to say I love you

I just called to say how much I care

I just called to say I love you

And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

No summer's high, no warm July

No harvest moon to light one tender August night

No autumn breeze, no falling leaves

Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies

No Libra sun, no Halloween

No giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring

But what it is, though old, so new

To fill your heart like no three words could ever do

I just called to say I love you

I just called to say how much I care, I do

I just called to say I love you

And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

I just called to say I love you, yeah

I just called to say how much I care, I do

I just called to say I love you

And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

Of my heart, of my heart

Baby, of my heart

# Woman

## Born Again  

(Ooh) If you tried just a little more times

I would've made you a believer

Would've showed you what it's like (I would've showed you)

Every single night (Night)

In the car, top down, black shades on, uh (Lookin' so good, can I add?)

And I just broke up with my man, like mm (A very, very silly, silly man)

One ex in the passenger seat 'cause I'm done (Done, yeah, never, ever goin' back)

Down, down, rude boy, get your foot up on my dash

Got all the receipts, I'm a businesswoman

Little bit of heartbreak

A little bit of "How could you do that?"

A little bit of talkin' out your ass

A little bit of "Look at what you had but could not hold"

And that's on you, baby, too bad

I'm about to make it heard as I vroom-vroom

Ice-cold how I leave you 'lone, but please

Tell your mother I'ma miss her so

If you tried just a little more times

I would've made you a believer

Would've showed you what it's like (Like)

Every single night

To be born again, baby, to be born again

If you stayed just another few nights

I could've made you pray to Jesus

Would've showed you to the light (To the light)

Every single night (Every night)

To be born again, baby, to be born again

Non-believer

You've bitten from the fruit but can't give back

Nice to leave ya

But I would be a fool not to ask

Do your words seem gospel to ya now? (Your words seem gospel to you now?)

Keepin' me strong

Choosin' to carry on after one

Too many lies would be wrong, so wrong

Said, he popped tags on my shoppin' spree

Stayed mad when I showed him all the long receipts

They laugh, but you crashed out like a comedy

I can't be your sugar mom, get a job for me, shit

(Ah, so) Boy, let go

Or let me live happily forever after more

I hope you learned somethin' from a lil' fiasco

You played the game smart lettin' lil' me pass go 'cause

If you tried just a little more times

I would've made you a believer

Would've showed you what it's like (Like)

Every single night (Night)

To be born again, baby, to be born again

If you stayed just another few nights

I could've made you pray to Jesus

Would've showed you to the light (To the light)

Every single night (Every night)

To be born again, baby, to be born again

Seasoned like the cinnamon the way I'm gettin' rid of him

I'm only gonna make you need religion at the minimum

And I'ma do it diligent, I'm lookin' for a synonym

I'm tryna find the words to tell him I ain't even feelin' him (I pray)

Don't ever let me be deficient in

Wish that you could wake up and then take me like a vitamin

I learned the hard way to let go now to save my soul (Oh)

If you tried just a little more times

I would've made you a believer

Would've showed you what it's like (Like)

Every single night

To be born again, baby, to be born again

If you stayed just another few nights

I could've made you pray to Jesus

Would've showed you to the light (To the light)

Every single night (Every night)

To be born again, baby, to be born again

Baby, to be born, oh, baby, baby, to be born again

To be born again, baby, to be born again

Baby, to be born, oh, baby, baby, to be born again (Yeah)

To be born again, baby, to be born again

O estilo diferente, que prende e dá prazer

Eu sei que logo sente, te faz enlouquecer

Faço ferver

Vai passar mal

Viro sua mente com meu corpo sensual

Minha boca é quente, vem

Não tem igual

Tá todo carente no pedido informal

Vai passar mal...

Viro sua mente com meu corpo sensual

Minha boca é quente, vem

Não tem igual

Vai passar mal...

Ai, papai!

Vem, mainha, vem!

Vem neguinha, vem!

Vem neguinho, vem!

Arrebenta!

Vai passar mal

Viro sua mente com meu corpo sensual

Minha boca é quente, vem

Não tem igual

Tá todo carente no pedido informal

Vai passar mal...

Vai passar mal

Viro sua mente com meu corpo sensual

Minha boca é quente, vem

Tá todo carente no pedido informal

Vai passar mal...

Gostosa!

Seu amor me pegou

'Cê bateu tão forte com o teu amor

Nocauteou, me tonteou

Veio à tona, fui à lona, foi K.O.

Sempre fui guerreira, mas foi de primeira

Me vi indefesa, coração perdeu a luta, sim

Adeus bebedeira, vida de solteira

Quero sexta-feira estar contigo na minha cama, juntos, coladin'

Me beija a noite inteira, sexy na banheira

Vou te dar canseira, quero do início até o fim

E fixa o olhar, fico a te olhar

Vou te falar, fui à lona com o seu—

## Amor de Que  

Brabo Music

O que os olhos não veem o coração não sente

Eu tenho um jeito de amar bem diferente

O que você não vê é que as outras mentem

Eu tô dizendo a verdade na tua frente

Veja bem, não é maldade

É que tem tanto homem bonito na cidade

E eu tô na flor da idade

Melhor se arrepender do que passar vontade

Eu espero que você entenda

Que o meu amor é amor de quenga

Eu não quero que você se prenda

No meu amor (Meu amor), amor de quenga (Amor de quenga)

Eu sento, tu sente

Eu sento, tu sente

Eu sento, tu sente

Assim é a gente

Eu sento, tu sente

Eu sento, tu sente

Eu sento, tu sente

Assim é a gente

E o que os olhos não veem o coração não sente

Eu tenho um jeito de amar bem diferente

O que você não vê é que as outras mentem

Eu tô dizendo a verdade na tua frente

Veja bem, não é maldade

É que tem tanto homem bonito na cidade

## Sweet Dreams  

Turn the lights on

Every night, I rush to my bed

With hopes that maybe I'll get a chance

To see you when I close my eyes

I'm goin' out of my head

Lost in a fairy tale

Can you hold my hands and be my guide?

Clouds filled with stars cover your skies

And I hope it rains

You're the perfect lullaby

What kind of dream is this?

You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare

Either way, I don't wanna wake up from you (Turn the lights on)

Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare

Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true (Turn the lights on)

My guilty pleasure, I ain't goin' nowhere

Baby, long as you're here, I'll be floatin' on air, 'cause you're mine

You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare

Either way, I don't wanna wake up from you (Turn the lights on)

I mention you when I say my prayers

I wrap you around all of my thoughts

Boy, you my temporary high

I wish that when I wake up, you're there

To wrap your arms around me for real

And tell me you'll stay by my side

Clouds filled with stars cover the skies (Cover the skies)

And I hope it rains

You're the perfect lullaby

What kind of dream is this?

You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare

Either way, I don't wanna wake up from you (Turn the lights on)

Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare

Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true (Turn the lights on)

My guilty pleasure, I ain't goin' nowhere

Baby, long as you're here, I'll be floatin' on air, 'cause you're mine

You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare

Either way, I don't wanna wake up from you (Turn the lights on)

Tattoo your name across my heart

So it will remain

Not even death could make us part

What kind of dream is this?

You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare

Either way, I don't wanna wake up from you (Turn the lights on)

Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare

Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true (Turn the lights on)

## Kill This Love  

Yeah, yeah, yeah

BLACKPINK IN YOUR AREA!

Yeah, yeah, yeah

After a sweet "Hi", there's always a bitter "Bye"

After every crazy high, there's a price you have to pay

There's no answer to this test, I'll always fall for it, yes

I'm a slave to my emotions

Screw this heartless love

Here I come kick in the door, uh

Give me the strongest one, uh

So obvious, that love, love

Give me more, give me some more

Cling onto the edge of the cliff if you want

With just one word, you're like starstruck again

That warm nervous feeling, extreme excitement

Felt like heaven, but

You might not get in it

Look at me, look at you

Who will be in more pain?

You smart like who? You are

If you cry tears of blood from both eyes

So sorry like who? You are

What should I do? I can't stand being so weak

While I force myself to cover my eyes

I need to bring an end to this love

Let's kill this love!

Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah

Rum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum

Let's kill this love!

Rum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum

Feelin' like a sinner

It's so fire with him I go boo-hoo

He said "You look crazy"

Thank you, baby

I owe it all to you

Got me all messed up

His love is my favorite

But you plus me

Sadly can be dangerous

Lucky me, lucky you

After all, in the end we lie

So what? So what?

If I end up forgetting you

So sorry

I'm not sorry

What should I do? I can't stand being so weak

While I force myself to hide my tears

I need to bring an end to this love

Let's kill this love!

Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah

Rum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum

Let's kill this love!

Rum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum

We all commit to love

That makes you cry, oh-oh

We're all making love

That kills you inside, yeah

We must kill this love (Yeah, yeah!)

Yeah, it's sad but true

Gotta kill this love (Yeah, yeah!)

Before it kills you too

Kill this love (Yeah, yeah!)

I may look sweet, but I don't act like it (Huh)

My slender figure hides twice the volume (Yah, yah, double up)

I give it to them straighton't care what people think (Woo!)

If it's black, then it's pink, we are pretty savage (BLACKPINK!)

When we want, we'll steal outright (Uh)

Whatever you do, it's like cutting water with a knife (Uh)

Our hands are full with a fat check

If you're curious, fact check

Expectations higher just like fish in the water

I'm a little toxic

You've fallen for me, I'm Foxy

Think twice

I can't act nice like other people

Don't be mistaken

I only smile easily for myself

You may not know well yet

If you want, then test me

You're so predictable

If you wanted something easy

Oh, wait 'til I do what I do

Hit you with that ddu-du, ddu-du, du

The path I walk now, BLACKPINK 4 way intersection

North, South, East, West, all ways run it

All of your bucket list, I bought it

Pulling you and pushing you far away

I do it however I want because I'm a bad girl

Whether you like me or hate me or whatever anyone says

When the bass drop, it's another banger

Think twice

I can't act nice like other people

Don't be mistaken

I only smile easily for myself

You may not know well yet

If you want, then test me

You're so predictable

If you wanted something easy

Oh, wait 'til I do what I do

## Асфальт  

Hello, hello, there's no connection again

This cold of yours ignores the summer

I don't read, I'll scroll through the feed

And you read, but without an answer

I dream of seeing you here

But I think you're better off without

I'll stay in this sad dance

And I won't be able to sing like this anymore

Half-drunk, half-wet rain

Your tears melt my palm

I don't even know who I'm singing about

You're all different, like a kaleidoscope

You burn my steps, a bunch of calls

Cards under the table, guns on the table

You ask: "leave me", I ask: "wait"

Put my love in its place

The asphalt is wet, like my eyes

I'm cutting along the Moscow Ring Road

It's spring here, and I empty, like my tank

Leave me, exchange me for girls and enjoy

I know that you know that I know that you're there

The asphalt is wet, like my eyes

I'm cutting along the Moscow Ring Road

It's spring here, and I'm empty, like my tank

Leave me, exchange me for girls and enjoy

I know that you know that I know that you're there

Hello, how are you? And I, here, sing to you

And it seems to resonate with spring

I'm not with him, and you're not with her

Didn't have time to explain

And there's no more of us

But you drove yourself, fell again

Your five-point corral blew everything up

You're burning, burning, burning my profile

You're burning everything, because flowers are no profit

Leave me to believe again

Stop, you're not an enemy yet

I knew about another new one, you have one last chance (Asphalt is wet, like mine...)

Asphalt is wet, like my eyes

I'm cutting along the Moscow Ring Road

It's spring here, and I'm empty, like my tank

Leave me, exchange me for girls and enjoy

I know that you know that I know that you're there

Asphalt is wet, like my eyes

I'm cutting along the Moscow Ring Road

It's spring here, and I empty, like my tank

Leave me, exchange me for girls and enjoy

I know that you know that I know that you are there

## Rehab  

Baby, baby, when we first met

I never felt somethin' so strong

You were like my lover and my best friend

All wrapped into one, with a ribbon on it

And all of a sudden, you went and left

I didn't know how to follow

It's like a shot that spun me around and now my heart left

I feel so empty and hollow

And I'll never give myself to another the way I gave it to you

Don't even recognize the ways you hurt me, do you?

It's gonna take a miracle to bring me back

And you're the one to blame

And now I feel like, oh, you're the reason why I'm thinkin'

I don't wanna smoke on these cigarettes no more

I guess that's what I get for wishful thinkin'

I should've never let you enter my door

Next time you wanna go on and leave

I should just let you go on and do it (Do it)

'Cause now I'm usin' like I bleed

It's like I checked into rehab

And baby, you're my disease

It's like I checked into rehab

And baby, you're my disease

I gotta check into rehab

'Cause baby, you're my disease

I gotta check into rehab

'Cause baby, you're my disease

Damn, ain't it crazy when you're love swept?

You'll do anything for the one you love

'Cause anytime that you needed me, I'd be there

It's like you were my favorite drug

The only problem is that you was usin' me

In a different way that I was using you

But now that I know it's not meant to be

You gotta go, I gotta wean myself off of you

And I'll never give myself to another the way I gave it to you

Don't even recognize the ways you hurt me, do you? (Recognize, oh)

It's gonna take a miracle to bring me back

And you're the one to blame

'Cause now I feel like, oh, you're the reason why I'm thinkin'

I don't wanna smoke on these cigarettes no more

I guess that's what I get for wishful thinkin'

I should've never let you enter my door (Let you enter my door)

Next time you wanna go on and leave

I should just let you go on and do it (Do it)

'Cause now I'm usin' like I bleed (Using like I bleed)

It's like I checked into rehab (Oh)

And baby, you're my disease (You're my disease)

It's like I checked into rehab
