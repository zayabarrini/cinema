# The neighbourhood



## I love You, 2013





### How



How could you question God's existence

When you question God Himself? (Mmh)

Why would you ask for God's assistance

If you wouldn't take the help?

If you're gone, then I need you

If you're gone, then how is any of this real?

When I'm on, I believe you

When I'm not, my knees don't even seem to feel

How could you tell me that I'm great

When they chewed me up, spit me out, pissed on me?

Why would you tell me that it's fate

When they laughed at me, every day, in my face?

They say the end is coming sooner

But the end's already here, oh (ah)

I say, "Today is but a rumor

That we'll laugh at in a year

Or two, or three, or four, or five, whatever"

If you're gone, then I need you

If you're gone, then how is any of this real?

When I'm on, I believe you

When I'm not, my knees don't even seem to feel, oh

How could you tell me that I'm great

When they chewed me up, spit me out, pissed on me?

Why would you tell me that it's fate

When they laughed at me, every day, in my face?

How could you tell me that I'm great

When they chewed me up, spit me out, pissed on me?

Why would you tell me that it's fate

When they laughed at me, every day, in my face?

How? (How could you tell me that I'm great?)

How?

How? (How could you tell me that it's fate?)

How?

How?





### Afraid



I wake up, I'm afraid somebody else might take my place

I wake up, I'm afraid somebody else might take my place

Make that money, fake that bunny, ache my tummy

On the fence, all the time

Paint junk honey, your face so sunny, ain't that funny?

All my friends always lie to me

I know they're thinking

You're too mean, I don't like you, fuck you anyway

You make me wanna scream at the top of my lungs

It hurts but I won't fight you

You suck anyway

You make me wanna die, right when I

When I wake up, I'm afraid somebody else might take my place

When I wake up, I'm afraid somebody else might take my place

When I wake up, I'm afraid somebody else might take my place

When I wake up, I'm afraid somebody else might end up being me

Keep on dreaming, don't stop breathing, fight those demons

And sell your soul, not your whole self, oh

If they see it when you're sleeping, make them leave it

I can't even see if it's all there anymore, so

You're too mean, I don't like you, fuck you anyway

You make me wanna scream at the top of my lungs

It hurts but I won't fight you

You suck anyway

You make me wanna die, right when I

When I wake up, I'm afraid somebody else might take my place

When I wake up, I'm afraid somebody else might take my place

When I wake up, I'm afraid somebody else might take my place

When I wake up, I'm afraid somebody else might end up being me

Being me can only mean

Feeling scared to breathe

If you leave me then I'll be afraid of everything

That makes me anxious, gives me patience, calms me down

Lets me face this, let me sleep, and when I wake up

Let me be

When I wake up, I'm afraid somebody else might take my place

When I wake up, I'm afraid somebody else might take my place

When I wake up, I'm afraid somebody else might take my place

When I wake up, I'm afraid somebody else might end up being me



### Everybody's Watching Me (Uh Oh)



I told you I would tell you everything you want to know

You want me to tell you now

You pressure me to shout it, need to hear about it

Think that I would count you out

Hold up

You know I gotta do it the right way, mane, you know what I'm sayin'?

Holding it down for H Town

Holding it down for all the real Chopped Not Slopped Up lovers all over the world, mane

You feel me?

Yeah, rest in peace to DJ Screw, the creator

OG Ron C

ChopStars

I told you I would tell you everything you want to know

I told you I would tell you everything you want to know

I told you I would tell you everything you want to know

You want me to tell you now

You pressure me to shout it, need to hear about it

Think-think that I would count you out

I let you find it on your own

Then I found myself alone

Uh oh, where can I go?

Everybody's watching me

Uh oh, where can I go?

Everybody's watching me

Ooh ooh, what can I do

If you're not here to tell you?

Uh oh, where can I go?

Everybody's watching me

I go through all the trouble of keeping it within my walls

I go through all the trouble of keeping it within my walls

I go through all the trouble of keeping it within my walls

I go through all the trouble of keeping it within my walls

I try to be as subtle as I can

Soon enough it eats me, all I've done defeats me

It looks like you were right again

And again

I let you find it on your own

Then I found myself alone

Uh oh, where can I go?

Everybody's watching me

Uh oh, where can I go?

Everybody's watching me

Ooh ooh, what can I do

If you're not here to tell you?

Uh oh, where can I go?

Everybody's watching me

The more I'm wanted, the more I'm wanted

The less I'm home, the less I'm home

If I'm forgotten, if I'm forgotten

I'll be alone, I'll be alone, I'll be alone

With everybody watching me

Uh oh, where can I go?

Everybody's watching me

Uh oh, where can I go?

Everybody's watching me

Ooh ooh, what can I do

If you're not here to tell you?

Uh oh, where can I go?

Everybody's watching me

Watching me, watching me, me, me

They're watching me, me, me

They're watching me, me, me

Watching me, me, me (yeah)

Everybody's watching me (ChopStars)



### Sweater Weather



And all I am is a man

I want the world in my hands

I hate the beach but I stand

In California with my toes in the sand

Use the sleeves of my sweater

Let's have an adventure

Head in the clouds but my gravity's centered

Touch my neck and I'll touch yours

You in those little high-waisted shorts, oh

She knows what I think about

And what I think about

One love, two mouths

One love, one house

No shirt, no blouse

Just us, you find out

Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no

'Cause it's too cold

For you here and now

So let me hold

Both your hands in the holes of my sweater

And if I may just take your breath away

I don't mind if there's not much to say

Sometimes the silence guides our minds

So move to a place so far away

The goosebumps start to raise

The minute that my left hand meets your waist

And then I watch your face

Put my finger on your tongue

'Cause you love to taste, yeah

These hearts adore

Everyone the other beats hardest for

Inside this place is warm

Outside it starts to pour

Coming down

One love, two mouths

One love, one house

No shirt, no blouse

Just us, you find out

Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no, no, no

'Cause it's too cold

For you here and now

So let me hold

Both your hands in the holes of my sweater

'Cause it's too cold

For you here and now

So let me hold

Both your hands in the holes of my sweater, whoa

Whoa, whoa, whoa

Whoa, whoa, whoa

Whoa, whoa

Whoa, whoa, whoa

Whoa, whoa

'Cause it's too cold

For you here and now

So let me hold

Both your hands in the holes of my sweater

It's too cold

For you here and now

Let me hold

Both your hands in the holes of my sweater

And it's too cold

It's too cold

The holes of my sweater



### Let It Go



A little city with expensive taste

Where the cars don't run 'til the engine breaks

Wasn't spending pennies on massive things

But invested in mess with this recipe

Couldn't quite see what the future held

And as days went by, it would tell itself

Let it struggle just a little bit more

Let it struggle just a little bit more

From a little city with expensive taste

Where the cars don't run 'til the engine breaks

From a little city with expensive taste

Where the cars don't run 'til the engine breaks

From a little city with expensive taste

Where the cars don't run 'til the engine breaks

Wasn't spending pennies on massive things

But invested in mess with this recipe

Couldn't quite see what the future held

And as days went by, it would tell itself

Let it struggle just a little bit more

Let it struggle just a little bit more

Remember what the people said

Remember what the people said

Said-said and done

Let it go

Remember what the people said

Remember what the people said

Said-said and done

Let it go

Shouldn't try to fix it if it keeps getting better

Shouldn't try to fix it if it keeps getting better

Shouldn't try to fix it if it keeps getting better

Just let it go, forget it forever and ever and ever

Don't ever resent a letter inside a single word written

A little change can pave lanes with the right vision

Couldn't tell what would happen next

But as weeks went by, good would turn to best

Let it struggle just a little bit more

Let it struggle just a little bit more

Remember what the people said

Remember what the people said

Said-said and done

Let it go

Remember what the people said

Remember what the people said

Said-said and done

Let it go

If what they said was all pretend, then it'd be different

If it depended on if anyone was listening

And I was listening

And when they said that what I wanted was a figment

I had to turn the other cheek, but I was listening

Yeah, I was listening, listening to all

Remember what the people said

Remember what the people said

When it's said and done

Let it go

Remember what the people said

Remember what the people said

When it's said and done

Let it go

Remember what the people said

Remember what the people said

I wasn't listening

I wasn't listening, listening at all

Remember what the people said

Remember what the people said

Oh, I wasn't listening

I wasn't listening, listening at all

At all, at all

Yeah, you like that baby

A lil' drizzle

Well, I love you too





### Alleyways [Explicit]



If things were different, we were young

Skinny-dipping, having fun

I remember

Back in 1991, when the story first begun

I remember (I remember)

All of these shells, holding the things I've done

I knew myself before I knew anyone, I did, I did

And 'cause we all chew gum, we all have fun with water guns

La-da-da-da-da-da

Da-da-dum-dum-dum

And we all grew up, shit got tough

Shit just wasn't simple enough, no

Ah, oh

Ah, oh

Ah

And whenever the sun came out, we played

(We didn't wanna get older, we didn't wanna get older)

We would run on the block all night and day

(We didn't wanna get older)

What a mistake saying the way I felt

I'd say my main influence is myself

And 'cause I started young, I learned a ton, I didn't run

La-da-da-da-da-da-da

I was scared as fuck and out of touch

And I was still testing my luck, oh

Ah, oh

Ah, oh

Ah

And whenever the sun came out, we played

(We didn't wanna get older, we didn't wanna get older)

We would run on the block all night and day

(We didn't wanna get older, we didn't wanna get older)

And whenever the sun came out, we played

(We didn't wanna get older, we didn't wanna get older)

I left myself in the alleyway

If things were different, we were young

Skinny-dipping, having fun

I remember (I left myself in the alleyway)

All I wanted would become everything I ever loved

I remember (I left myself in the alleyway)



### W.D.Y.W.F.M?



Two nights ago, she got that look in her eyes

Kaleidoscope, but that's only half the time

Three days before she told me that I don't even try

She's crazy, through, I guess there's something wrong inside

Maybe you're right, maybe this is all that I can be

But what if it's you, and it wasn't me?

What do you want from me?

What do you want from me?

Four weeks ahead, I thought that I should think some more

I'm fucked in the head, and my mind is turning into a whore

Five months go by, and I thought about letting her go

She's crazy, though, and I guess she took control

Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no

Maybe you're right, maybe this is all that I can be

But what if it's you, and it wasn't me?

What do you want from me?

What do you want from me?

Maybe she's right, maybe I'm wrong

Maybe we'll fight 'til it moves us along

I can't deny writing a song

Hoping she'll find she's not alone

Maybe you're right, maybe this is all that I can be

But what if it's you, and it wasn't me?

What do you want from me?

What do you want, what do you want

What do you want from me?

What do you want, what do you want from me now



### Flawless



She planned ahead for a year

He said, "Let's play it by ear"

She didn't want him to run

He didn't want her to fear

Nobody said it'd be easy

They knew it was rough, but tough luck

I fell in love today

There aren't many words that you can say

That could ever get my mind to change

She's enough for me, she's in love with me

You're a doll, you are flawless

But I just can't wait for love to destroy us

I just can't wait for love

The only flaw, you are flawless

But I just can't wait for love to destroy us

I just can't wait for love

So, she put his heart in a bag

He wouldn't ask for it back

He didn't want her to cry

She didn't want to be sad

She said, you'd better not leave me

This shit it'll be fucked for days, and weeks, and months, but

I fell in love today

There aren't many words that you can say

That could ever get my mind to change

She's enough for me, she's in love with me

You're a doll, you are flawless

But I just can't wait for love to destroy us

I just can't wait for love

The only flaw, you are flawless

But I just can't wait for love to destroy us

I just can't wait for love

When I add it all up, I can't find it

The problem with love, is I'm blinded by it

It rattles my lungs, but my mind is

Tangled between your little flaws

Your flaws, your flaws, your flaws

You're a doll, you are flawless

But I just can't wait for love to destroy us

I just can't wait for love

The only flaw, you are flawless

But I just can't wait for love to destroy us

I just can't wait for love

Wait for love

I won't wait for love

Wait for love

I won't wait for love

Wait for love



### Female Robbery



I think I found hell, I think I found something

I think I found something in my TV screen

I think I found out that I have nothing

That I have nothing in this place for me

I watched it all in my head, perfect sense

They'll take me from my bed

Leave everything that is worth a single cent

And just take me instead

That TV show I saw as I fell asleep

Had me on both knees

Praying to whatever is in heaven

Please, send me a felon

Don't let the police know

Anything, anything

Don't tell them anything, anything, please

Anything, anything

Don't tell them anything, anything, please, oh

I think I can tell, I think I can tell them

Tell them they were made for me

I'm thinking they'll know, know it already

I'm thinking they'll know just about everything

I bet they planned it all out like the shows

Went everywhere I go

Walked in the store right behind me

Stood in line right beside me and followed me to my home

I'm sure they figured it out early on

That I would never run

That they could shoot, but that's no fun

'Cause then they're killing the stolen son, oh

Anything, anything

Don't tell them anything, anything, please

Anything, anything

Don't tell them anything, anything, please

Anything, anything

Don't tell them anything, anything, please

Anything, anything

Don't tell them anything, anything, please

We're gonna die, die, die, die, die, die

We're gonna die, die, die, die

We're gonna die, die, die, die, die, die (I think I found love)



### Staying Up



No food to eat, all the money's been wasted from last week

I can't even leave, so I sleep in the basement, making up rap beats

Hot cup of tea, it's four o'clock in the middle of the night, and I can't sleep

It's all on the peak, so bad I can taste it while it eats me

How can I sleep if I don't have dreams?

I just have nightmares

How can it be?

I still believe something is out there

Some part of me feels a little bit naked and empty

I'm stuck underneath a few dirty old blankets to comfort me

How can I sleep if I don't have dreams?

I just have nightmares

How can it be?

I still believe something is out there

How can I sleep if I don't have dreams?

I just have nightmares

How can it be?

I still believe something is out there

And there's a light, and I can see why I'm still alive

Mommy won't lie, 'cause if she did, I would've died

All the time I sit and try, you think I'd be down

Every night, I'm sick and why, oh, I'm staying up this time

How can I sleep if I don't have dreams?

I just have nightmares

How can it be?

I still believe something is out there

How can I sleep if I don't have dreams?

I just have nightmares

How can it be?

I still believe something is out there



### Float



Imagine breathing in

Imagine leaving all your air behind

What matters in the end

A matter of opinion 'til you find out

Life can only mean hardly anything

All I'll ever be is partly settled in

To show you how to swim, then they throw you in the deep end

I've been learning since, but it doesn't mean I'll float, oh no

I won't float, no, no, no, no, won't float

I had a funny sleep,

I didn't have a dream

'Cause I don't believe in them

Life can only mean hardly anything

All I'll ever be is partly settled in

To show you how to swim, then they throw you in the deep end

Well I've been learning since, but it doesn't mean I'll float oh no no no

I won't float, no, no, no, no, oh

Float away, float away, then come right back to me

Float away, float away, then come right back to me

To show you how to swim, then they throw you in the deep end

Well I've been learning since, but it doesn't mean I'll float

To show you how to swim, then they throw you in the deep end

Well I've been learning since, but it doesn't mean I'll float no oh no

I won't float

What if I, what if I don't float?

What if I don't float?

I think I'll float, I'll float

I'll float away



## Wiped Out! 2015



### A Moment of Silence





### Prey



As long as you notice

I'm hoping that you'll keep your heart open

I'll keep mine open too (I'll keep mine open too)

If you don't ask, I won't tell

Just know that, just know that

It all hurts, it all hurts just the same

Something is wrong, I can't explain

Everything changed when the birds came

You never know what they might do

If they catch you too early

We need to fly ourselves before someone else tells us how

Something is off, I feel like prey, I feel like praying

As long as you notice

I'm hopin' that you'll keep your heart open

I'll keep mine open too (I'll keep mine open too)

So, so I'll probably take you aside

Tell you what's on my mind

But you, you'll just keep it inside

Probably tell me that you're alright

Something is wrong, I can't explain

Everything changed when the birds came

You never know what they might do

If they catch you too early

We need to fly ourselves before someone else tells us how

Something is off, I feel like prey, I feel like praying

if I run away I'll never know

(What you want)

And if you go then I'll never grow

(I'm undone)

Let me slip, let me slide

(If you run) I'll look for you to fly

Something is off, I can't explain

You know what I mean, don't you?

Something I saw or something I did that made me like this

Could you help me?

We need to fly ourselves before someone else tells us how

Something is off, I feel like prey, I feel like praying

Something is off, I feel like prey, I feel like praying

So, so I'll probably take you aside

Tell you what's on my mind

But you, you'll just keep it inside

Probably tell me that you're alright

So, so I'll probably take you aside

Tell you what's on my mind

But you, you'll just keep it inside

Probably tell me that you're alright

I don't wanna fight

I don't wanna fight

I don't wanna fight

I don't wanna fight





### Cry Baby



I think I talk too much

I need to listen, baby

I need to listen, baby

I need to listen good

I think I try too hard

How I look, what I do, what I'm sayin'

I spend too much time explainin' myself

I hope there's some time to change it

I can taste it, my heart's breakin', please don't say

That you know, when you know

I can't take it, I'm impatient, tell me, baby

Now I know, you should go

I know I'll fall in love with you, baby

And that's not what I wanna do

I hope you won't ever lie to me

And if you do, I know I won't be your cry baby

I think I worry a lot

I need to take it easy

I've got this anxious feeling

But it goes away for a minute when I'm with you, breathing

I can taste it, my heart's breakin', please don't say

That you know, when you know

I can't take it, I'm impatient, tell me, baby

Now I know, you should go

I know I'll fall in love with you, baby

And that's not what I wanna do

I hope you won't ever lie to me

And if you do, I know I won't be your cry baby

The Sun's coming out but I'm feeling colder

I can't wait 'til the drought is over

I know I'll fall in love with you, baby

Yeah, that's just what I'll do

I hope you won't ever lie to me

And if you do, I know I won't be your cry baby

I know I'll fall in love with you, baby

And that's not what I wanna do

I hope you won't ever lie to me

And if you do, I know I won't be your cry baby

Cry baby, cry baby

I need to cry, baby

Cry baby, cry baby

You need to cry, baby

Cry baby, cry baby

We need to cry

And if we do, I know that would be alright



### Wiped Out!



Lost and afraid

Young and innocent but getting older

I don't wanna be alone

I don't wanna be alone

Sharper the blade is

The easier it scars your soul

I don't wanna be alone

I don't wanna be alone

My current state

Is heavy

Hope it's a phase

Or something

Don't let me go

Up and away, I'm an alien

I need a moment

I don't know what to believe

All I wanna do is leave

What can I say that would make you see

Make you need me?

Maybe I will never know

Maybe I'll end up alone

Running in place (circles, in circles with you)

Don't mind me

Out in a race (why are you leading me here?)

Watch me go

I don't wanna let you down

So promise you won't let me drown

How can you feel the way that I'm feeling

If you're not inside my head?

I got the pressure that's pushing my buttons

And making me think about death

I got some mixed emotions

About how I'ma get to handle the stress

I didn't offer it because of the money

It's making my tummy upset

How can you feel the way that I'm feeling

If you're not inside my head?

I got the pressure that's pushing my buttons

And making me think about death

Somebody find me, embarassed

Look what I did to myself and my friends

Emotions are paying the rent, oh

Emotions are paying the rent, oh

I'm back and forth, I think I'm going crazy

I'm back and forth, I can't make up my mind

I'm hoping that I'm never sati-

I'm hoping that I'm never satisfied

I'm back and forth, I think I'm going crazy

I'm back and forth, I can't make up my mind

I'm hoping that I'm never sati-

I'm hoping that I'm never satisfied

I'm back and forth, I think I'm going crazy

I'm back and forth, I can't make up my mind

I'm hoping that I'm never sati-

I'm hoping that I'm never satisfied

I'm back and forth, I think I'm going crazy

I'm back and forth, I can't make up my mind

I'm hoping that I'm never sati-

I'm hoping that I'm never satisfied



### The Beach



If I told you that I loved you

Tell me, what would you say?

If I told you that I hated you

Would you go away?

Now I need your help with everything that I do

I don't want to lie, I've been relying on you

Fallin' again, I need a pick-me-up

I've been callin' you friend, I might need to give it up

I'm sick and I'm tired too

I can admit, I am not fireproof

I feel it burning me

I feel it burning you

I hope I don't murder me

I hope I don't burden you

If I do, I do

If I meet you in the middle maybe we could agree

You make me feel little how you're looking at me

And you can throw me shade, all it does is just cool me off

First it just threw me off, now I'm just moving on

Fallin' again, I need a pick-me-up

I've been callin' you friend, I might need to give it up

I'm sick and I'm tired too

I can admit, I am not fireproof

I feel it burning me

I feel it burning you

I hope I don't murder me

I hope I don't burden you

Swim with me

I think I could see the beach

I know what's underneath

I need you here with me

But we're out in the open

Swim with me

I think I could see the beach

Just don't look underneath us

I need you here with me but we're out in the open

I'm sick and I'm tired too

I can admit, I am not fireproof

I feel it burning me

I feel it burning you

I hope I don't murder me

I hope I don't burden you

If I do, I do



### Daddy Issues



Take you like a drug

I taste you on my tongue

You ask me what I'm thinking about

I'll tell you that I'm thinking about

Whatever you're thinking about

Tell me something that I'll forget

And you might have to tell me again

It's crazy what you'll do for a friend

Go ahead and cry, little girl

Nobody does it like you do

I know how much it matters to you

I know that you got daddy issues

And if you were my little girl

I'd do whatever I could do

I'd run away and hide with you

I love that you got daddy issues

And I do too

I tried to write your name in the rain

But the rain never came

So I made with the sun

The shame always comes at the worst time

You ask me what I'm thinking about

I'll tell you that I'm thinking about

Whatever you're thinking about

Tell me something that I'll forget

And you might have to tell me again

It's crazy what you'll do for a friend

Go ahead and cry, little girl

Nobody does it like you do

I know how much it matters to you

I know that you got daddy issues

And if you were my little girl

I'd do whatever I could do

I'd run away and hide with you

I love that you got daddy issues

I keep on tryin' to let you go

I'm dyin' to let you know

How I'm getting on

I didn't cry when you left at first

But now that you're dead, it hurts

This time, I gotta know

Where did my daddy go?

I'm not entirely here

Half of me has disappeared

Go ahead and cry, little boy

You know that your daddy did too

You know what your mama went through

You gotta let it out soon, just let it out

Go ahead and cry, little girl

Nobody does it like you do

I know how much it matters to you

I know that you got daddy issues

And if you were my little girl

I'd do whatever I could do

I'd run away and hide with you

I love that you got daddy issues

And I do too

If you were my little girl

I'd do whatever I could do

I'd run away and hide with you

I love that you got daddy issues

And I do too





### Baby Came Home 2 / Valentines



She was five foot four

With some money on the floor

And box that's hidden under her bed

I was only twenty two

With a pocket full of truth

But I gave her everything that I had

We were born and raised in the Golden State

Mommy's gone and daddy's doing his best

I was brought up great living section eight

Social security's paying the rent, ooh

The landlord called, she said you gotta go

Little one you just lost your, ooh, yeah

She was five foot four

Getting money on tour

But her socks were at the end of my bed

Got our names tattooed on each other

Just to prove to each other

That we'd do what we said

Only took a few days

'Til our minds were made up

And we thought we should try it again

I was only seventeen when we first tried things

When she first made me feel like a man, oh

Who am I gonna call?

Who's gonna catch me when I

Who's the one you're sleeping with?

Who

Don't you sit in front of me

And wait for me to talk

You can call me up

Phone works two ways, you know

This time baby

And I think that I'll be just fine

I wish I could say the same for you

I, yeah I do

I, hey



### Greetings from Califournia



Ooh, I know once you come to California

You will never look back

Ooh, just a little bit can make you wonder

You got it in

Hands up it's a stick up

Nobody's leaving this room for a minute

Everyones breathing these fumes

That are in it

Sick of the people who make the decisions

Put your hands up it's a stick up

Hopefully God is still down to forgive us

Nobody's breathing

Who let the evil in?

What's in the water?

Are you bothered?

What's the problem here?

Ooh, I know once you come to California

You will never look back

Ooh, just a little bit can make you wonder

You got it in

I can feel it go down

I will feel it go down all the way

All the way

Give it to me slow now

Give it to me slow then wash away

It comes and comes

Ooh, I know once you come to California

You will never look back

Ooh, just a little bit can make you wonder

Handcuffed and I thought of you

I made love and I thought of you

My daddy died, I just thought of you

My sister cried and my mama too

I got a place and I thought of you

I tried to decorate and I thought of you

I'm seeing red but I'm singing blue

I never knew that black and white would fit you too

Anybody, somebody, please

I'm begging

I'm even on my knees

I've got a dozen insecurities

But I don't think you should be worried for me

No I don't think you should be worried for me

Ooh, I know once you come to California

You will never look back

Ooh, just a little bit can make you wonder

You got it in



### Ferrari



I want a new yellow Ferrari from the nineties in the driveway

But I know that you wouldn't like that

I want it now, I want it loud, I want it my way

But everybody doesn't fight like that

Don't tell me about the rules and break them

And don't tell me about mistakes

And make the same ones I have made before

Don't say you love me more

Better not say it

I met her at church

But she could be satan

You and I are two oceans apart

We're on earth to break each others hearts, in two

And it's hard with you

When I'm too far from you

I look at the stars, do you?

Don't tell me about the rules and break them

And don't tell me about mistakes

And make the same ones I have made before

Don't say you love me more

Better not say it

I met her at church

But she could be satan

You're LA and I'm Newbury Park

But you're the flame I use when it gets dark

You've got enough pain for both of us

I've got all these things I'm focused on

You treat all the rules like you're the queen

But you and I are few and far between



### Single



I don't know if we should be alone together

I still got a crush, that's obvious

If nobody's around, what's stopping us?

Everywhere I go, you show, wherever

I don't ever mind sharing oxygen

I just wanna get lost in your lungs

Just a baby, but she's growing up so fast

And I'm allergic to the waiting

She's just a baby girl

And I love to watch her dance

But it's making me go crazy

(Can you let your baby be my girl?)

(Can you let your baby be my girl?)

(Can you let your baby be my girl?)

(Can you let your baby be mine? Oh)

I don't think that we should be around each other

When you're in a room, you get my eyes

You open your mouth, I'm hypnotized, woah

I can make you laugh until you cry

You know you got all my attention

You know you got all mine

"Baby, " I can't help but call her that

Even though I shouldn't say it

She was my baby girl

I might never get her back

But I don't mind being patient, yeah

Can you let your baby be my girl?

Can you let your baby be my girl?

Can you let your baby be my girl?

Can you let your baby be mine?

Okay, I'm just gonna tell you what I gotta say, right here

I'm sorry Dave, I never meant to hurt your baby girl

She's your little baby, she's my soulmate

I don't want you to worry, she'll be so safe right here

Oh, so, Dave, would you let your baby be my girl?

Can you let your baby be my girl?

Can you let your baby be my girl?

Can you let your baby be my girl?

Can you let your baby be mine?

Oh, your baby, she's mine



### R.I.P.  My Youth



R.I.P. to my youth

And you could call this the funeral

I'm just telling the truth

And you can play this at my funeral

Wrap me up in Chanel inside my coffin

Might go to Hell and there ain't no stopping

Might be a sinner and I might be a saint

I'd like to be proud, but somehow I'm ashamed

Sweet little baby in a world full of pain

I gotta be honest, I don't know if I could take it

Everybody's talking, but what's anybody saying?

Mama said if I really want it, then I can change it, yeah

R.I.P. to my youth

If you really listen, then this is to you

Mama, there is only so much I can do

Tough for you to witness but it was for me too

I'm using white lighters to see what's in front of me (front of me)

R.I.P. to my youth

And you could call this the funeral

I'm just telling the truth, yeah

You can play this at my funeral

Tell my sister don't cry and don't be sad

I'm in paradise with dad

Close my eyes and then cross my arms

Put me in the dirt, let me dream with the stars

Throw me in a box with the oxygen off

You gave me the key then you locked every lock

When I can't breathe, I won't ask you to stop

When I can't breathe, don't call for a cop

I was naive and hopeful and lost

Now I'm aware and driving my thoughts, oh

What do I do? What do I do?

I don't believe it if I don't keep proof

I don't believe it if I don't know you

I don't believe it if it's on the news or on the internet

I need a cigarette

I'm using white lighters to see what's in front of me

I'm using white lighters to see

R.I.P. to my youth

And you could call this the funeral

I'm just telling the truth

And you can play this at my funeral

Tell my sister don't cry and don't be sad

I'm in paradise with dad

Close my eyes and then cross my arms

Put me in the dirt, let me be with the stars







## Hard to Imagine 2018





### Dust



No more water in the lake

No more fish in the ocean

They grew wings, flew away

I got a clue where they're going

They want a break, they want a break

No more water in the lake

No more fish in the ocean

They grew wings, flew away

I got a clue where they're going

They want a break, they want a break

All the lucky ones kept fucking it up

Threatened our lives but it wasn't enough

Didn't wanna sit down, couldn't listen to nobody

So everybody went out of control

Thrashing in platinum dust

Damage that can't be undone

Triumph of weapons

Everybody went to outer space

The second that the sun exploded

I'm the only fool who stayed

If you're reading this, I wrote it

All the lucky ones kept fucking it up

Threatened our lives but it wasn't enough

Didn't wanna sit down, couldn't listen to nobody

So everybody went out of control

Thrashing in platinum dust

Damage that can't be undone

Triumph of weapons

Body, so everybody went out of control

Body, so everybody went out of control

Body, so everybody went out of control

Body, so everybody went out of control

Body, so everybody went out of control

Body, so everybody went out of control

Body, so everybody went out of control

Body, so everybody went out of control



### Kill Us All



Yo, I drop gems like a bad jewel thief, I'm Kool Keith

Dr. Octagon with a delivery from the Octomom

The Unabomber with a unibrow, I stay connected

I make sure that the globe gets infected

Explosion, earthquakes, mudslides, erosion

Global domination, I'ma set it to a motion

Emotion only for the weaker being, make sure that nobody see

And show my intellect 'cause I'm a evil genius

Futurama, I hope you're ready to fry

You expect me to talk, I expect you to die

I hang you out to dry from the washing machine

It's like a movie critic way I'm peeping the scene, son

Said and done, when it's finished, my nigga, finito

When I go out, I go out with a pound of C4

This for everybody out there tryna play a hero

Yeah, it just might kill us all

It just might kill us all (yeah)

It just might kill us all (you know)

It just might kill us all (yeah, yeah, uh)

It just might kill us all

Be on watch, you know they wanna kill us all

Kill us all, yeah, can I die yet? Come along

1:25 in the valley, treading on a heatwave

I think we set the sky on fire, breathing in every day

Before you rise like a phoenix

You gotta play Jean Grey

I just wanna flex, I don't wanna be another ex, yeah

Keep it all up in my head now, when I see red, it's a let down

Always finding different ways to get down

Whole wide world gone to shit now but I can't quit now

Never been the type to just sit down

And shut up, enemies tryna run up, homie, but I keep it all 100

Minute that the sun up, I'm thinking 'bout the money

Yeah, it just might kill us all

It just might kill us all

It just might kill us all

It just might kill us all (yeah)

Fuck it, I love it

Hey, Jesse, run up the budget

I don't know what kind of idiot you think is gonna fall for this scam

But you people are in trouble.

You contacted the wrong person, bye





### 24/7



Daddy's little girl started growing up (up, up, up, up)

She left the suburbs in the summer 'cause she fell in love (love, love, love)

Temperature's 101

In the 405

Right around six-fifteen and she's gotta be back by nine

Honey's just twenty-two

And she doesn't know what to do

So I tell her "don't cry, can't worry 'bout time"

You can't worry 'bout time

And you can hit my line like 24/7, 24/7, 24/7

I'll be there to listen anytime

I'll be there to listen anytime

Mama's baby boy started blowin' up

Left his hometown, didn't slow down 'cause he never fell far enough

Headed out on PCH, mm (oh, yeah)

Doing fifty-eight, (oh, yeah) doesn't want to be too late (alright)

So he's switching lanes

But he's just twenty-five (hey!)

And he got his money, right?

So I told him "don't rush, just give it some time" (oh)

Just give it some time

You can hit my line like 24/7, 24/7, 24/7

I'll be there to listen anytime

I know what it means to you anytime

All day, every week, for you

I'll be there to listen and believe in you

It's the same thing that I really need from you

Time

And you can hit my line like 24/7, 24/7, 24/7

I'll be there to listen anytime

24/7, 24/7, 24/7

I'll be there to listen anytime

I'll be there to listen any



### Scary Love



Move to the city with me

I don't wanna be alone

(Don't wanna be alone)

You're too pretty for me

Baby, I know (it's true), yeah

You look better when you first wake up

Than anybody else I've fucked

Baby, I got good luck with you

I didn't know we'd get so far

And it's only the start

Baby, you got me worried (ayy)

Your love is scaring me

No one has ever cared for me

As much as you do

Ooh, yeah, I need you here, oh

Your love is scaring me

No one has ever cared for me

As much as you do

Ooh, yeah, I need you here

Drivin' through the city with me

Just watchin' you glow

I'm in the passenger seat, you're in control

(It's on you now) Mhm

You look better every day, I swear

Really, it's a little unfair

Baby, I'm star-struck by you

Didn't know we'd get so far

And it's only the start

Baby, you got me worried (ayy)

Your love is scaring me

No one has ever cared for me

As much as you do

Ooh, yeah, I need you here, oh

Your love is scaring me

No one has ever cared for me

If we fall apart, maybe it wasn't meant to be

If we fall apart, it was our favourite dream

Ooh, ooh, ahh-aaah

Your love is therapy

No drug can give me clarity

As much as you do (as you do, baby)

Ooh, yeah, I need you here (I need you here)

Oooh (hey, yeah), yeah, I need you here (oh-oh, oh-oh)

Ooh, ooh, ahh

(Yeah, yeah, I need you, baby)

Yeah

(Ooh ooh, I need you)



### Softcore



You've been my muse for a long time

You get me through every dark night

I'm always gone, out on the go

I'm on the run and you're home alone

I'm too consumed with my own life

Are we too young for this?

Feels like I can't move

Sharing my heart, it's tearing me apart

But I know I'd miss you, baby, if I left right now

Doing what I can, tryna be a man

And every time I kiss you, baby, I can hear the sound

Of breaking down

I've been confused as of late (yeah)

Watching my youth slip away (yeah)

You're like the sun, you wake me up

But you drain me out if I get too much

I might need room or I'll break

Are we too young for this?

Feels like I can't move

Sharing my heart, it's tearing me apart

But I know I'd miss you, baby, if I left right now

Doing what I can, tryna be a man

And every time I kiss you, baby, I can hear the sound

Of breaking down

I don't want to play this part

But I do, all for you

I don't want to make this hard

But I will 'cause I'm still

Sharing my heart, it's tearing me apart

But I know I'd miss you, baby, if I left right now (I know I would)

Doing what I can, tryna be a man (be your man)

And every time I kiss you, baby, I can hear the sound

Of breaking down



### Void



I wonder how I got by this week

I only touched you once

Lately I can't find the beat

I used to feel the rush

Started with a little bit

Now I don't know how to quit

Always feel inadequate

Same way that my daddy did

Mama told me not to try

And I should have taken her advice

And now I'm all twisted

When it's all gone, I miss it

I'll try just to do somethin'

I'll try 'cause I got nothin'

Else that gets me through the day

'Til I find another way

I'll try just to do somethin'

I'll try 'cause I got nothin'

Even if I lose again

I won't quit

I wonder how I got by this week

I only touched you once, uh

Lately I can't find a beat

I used to feel the rush

And now I need you to feel the vibe

I need you to see the point

I need you to feel alive

I need you to fill the void

My insecurities are

My own worst enemy, yeah

Something's not lettin' me

Move the way I used to

Thought you could better me but

Then you stopped lettin' me walk

Now you're just settin' me off

So I'm tryna lose you

I'll fight just to do somethin'

I'll fight 'cause I got nothin'

Else that gets me through the day

'Til I find another way

I'll fight just to do somethin'

I'll fight 'cause I got nothin'

Even if I lose again

I can't quit, mmm

I wonder how I got by this week

I only touched you once

Lately I can't find a beat

I used to feel the rush

And now I need you to feel the vibe

I need you to see the point

I need you to feel alive

I need you to fill the void

I need you to fill the void

I need you to fill the void

You paralyze me every time

I try to find some paradise

I've got to fill the void

And now I'm paranoid

You paralyze me every time

I try to find some paradise

I've got to fill the void

And now I'm paranoid



### Roll Call



You won't skip on ice

If you slipped on ice

Yeah, I should be there with you

Sorry, I forgot

Just run that race, little soldier

No one's gonna win any time soon

Just know your role, little soldier

Don't get left behind, right? Alright

Okay, how we gonna do this?

Someone's got a body, it's over, can't manoeuvre

Yeah, I wanna stay, but I don't want to fight

Used to feel like we were doin' alright

Then we got older, not good

Nobody does what they told you they would

Did what I should and what I was told

Kept my hopes high and my eyes half closed

They've got control of you, soldier

Put you in the field with a gun to shoot and kill 'em all

Just play your part, little soldier

Marchin' left, right, left, right

I wanna walk like me (like me)

I wanna talk like me (like me)

I don't wanna (I don't wanna)

Be another (be another), no (no)

I wanna walk like me (like me)

I wanna talk like me (like me)

No, I don't wanna (I don't wanna)

Be another (be another), no (no)

Uninvited to the desert

The summer will be cold, yeah

Undecided but I'm never really even sure

But it's so tempting

I wanna walk like me (like me)

I wanna talk like me (like me)

I don't wanna (I don't wanna)

Be another (be another), no (no)

I wanna walk like me (like me)

I wanna talk like me (like me)

No, I don't wanna (I don't wanna)

Be another (be another), no (no)

You won't skip on ice

If you slipped on ice

Yeah, I should be there with you

Sorry, I forgot



### Livin' In a Dream



Dream, where everybody loves me

Living in a dream world, how'd I get so lucky?

So tell me how you feel (tell me, tell me, tell me)

Ooh, baby, is anything real? (tell me, tell me, tell me)

Ooh, darling, haâI got nothing to lose (tell me, tell me, tell me)

Nothing to lose (nothing to lose)

I got nothing to prove

Nothing to you (ooh)

Movin' at a mile a minute

Set the pace, I'm goin' over the limit

Always wondered what I've been missing

The chequered flag doesn't mean that you're finished, oh

I got everything that I wanted

I built myself a house on the hill

All my passion fulfilled, saw it fast like a film

All that sadness and guilt, now I just wanna chill

But I can't, my suntans in Thailand

Swimming on a cloud made of hands

Money in my pockets, Louis wallet in my pants

No AC in the crib but I got plenty of fans

Said "I love you" too soon

Reached for the stars and I hit the moon

Now every time I look at you

Feels like dÃ©jÃ  vu, oh

Living in a dream

Where everybody loves me (everybody loves me)

Living in a dream world

How'd I get so lucky? (how'd I get so)

So tell me how you feel

Uh, I feel like a legend in these Puma suedes

I'ma still make millions when this music fade

Reinvent every time the music change

My gut had me feeling like I knew the way

I feel like I spoke for my generation

All game and my demonstration

To my gang, I'm a different greatness

Pay dues, never missed a payment

Stay true, now it's entertainment

Feel like I'm built for whatever storm

Whatever way the game test me, in whatever form

War in dark times that they never saw

I feel like I stand tall and can never fall (yeah)

I feel like a one on one (alright)

Like the last dope boy in the game with a hunnid tons (yeah)

2Pac got the troublesome, a boozy bad-ass

Drop a bag on you niggas if I want it done

Living in a dream

Where everybody loves me

(Everybody loves me)

Living in a dream world

How'd I get so lucky?

(How'd I get so)

So tell me how you feel

Now the war is over

Can't get any older



### You Get Me So High



Hope you don't regret it

I pushed a lot back but I can't forget it

We never got the credit

Nobody seemed to hear us, but we said it

Neither of us planned it

And for a long time I took it all for granted

I really thought we had it

But at the time it was more than I could manage, so

If we can leave it all behind us

And meet in-between

It would get me so

High all the time

High all the time

I wanna be high all the time

Would you come with me?

Wish I didn't doubt it

I wish I never ever told you all about it

But I just had to let you know

I never meant to hurt you though

I had all my motives

I didn't know they wouldn't mix with your emotions

I just had to reach my goals

Never knew I needed you though, so

If we can agree to disagree, yeah

Then keep on reaching

It would get you so

High all the time

High all the time

I wanna be high all the time

Would you come with me?

High all the time

High all the time

I wanna be high all the time

Would you come with me?

Used to stick together

You're my best friend, I'll love you forever

We could be the greatest

It doesn't matter if we're never rich or famous

High all the time

High all the time

I wanna be high all the time

Would you come with me?

If you can just let me know if it's okay

To call you when I'm lonely





### Reflections



Where have you been?

Do you know when you're comin' back?

Since you've been gone

I've got along, but I've been sad

I tried to put it out for you to get

Could've, should've, but you never did

Wish you wanted it a little bit

More, but it's a chore for you to give

Where have you been?

Do you know if you're comin' back?

We were too close to the stars

I never knew somebody like you, somebody

Fallin' just as hard

I'd rather lose somebody than use somebody

Maybe it's a blessing in disguise

(I see myself in you)

I see my reflection in your eyes

I know you're sick

Hopin' you fix whatever's broken

Ignorant bliss

And a few sips might be the potion

I tried to put it out for you to get

Coulda, shoulda, but you never did

Wish you wanted it a little bit

More, but it's a chore for you to give

Where have you been?

Do you know if you're comin' back?

We were too close to the stars

I never knew somebody like you, somebody

Fallin' just as hard

I'd rather lose somebody than use somebody

Maybe it's a blessing in disguise

(I see myself in you)

I see my reflection in your eyes

(Tell me you see it too)

So close, so close

Yet so far away (so far)

I don't know (I don't) how to be solo (no)

So don't go, oh, no, just stay

You and I were bright, shootin' through the sky daily (yeah)

Lightin' up the night, wasn't always right, baby (mm-hm)

Yeah, every time that we realign, it's crazy

And you save me

We were too close to the stars

I never knew somebody like you, somebody

Fallin' just as hard

I'd rather lose somebody than use somebody

Maybe it's a blessing in disguise

(I see myself in you)

I see my reflection in your eyes

(I sold my soul for you, I know you see it too)

Yeah, I bought the same ones too

I know you're tired, I know you tried

To say your point of view, yeah

Sick of all the poison in me

What the hell do you want from me, babe? Uh-huh

I see myself in you, I see myself in you, baby

I see myself in you, alright

I sold my soul for you, maybe you should stick with us now



### Blue



Read my mind, got me at a stop light

Start me up, then you make a stop like

"Why you gotta put me in the spotlight?"

But you don't even ever hit the spot right

You're always ridin' my wave

(Ridin', ridin', ridin', ridin')

But never ridin' through

You get me up to let me down

One too many times to count

Why you gotta do that? (Why?)

You're the one who blew that

Make it tough to get it out

You're done, but I'm ready now

Why you gotta do that? (Why?)

You're the one who blew that

Every time you come, you do

Every time you come, you do

Call me up to comfort you and now I'm like

"Baby, it's already been a long night"

Keep playin' it cool but it's time to change the mood

Get to movin' or you can move along

Stuck inside of your cage

(I'm stuck right now)

I play your game to lose over and over

You get me up to let me down

Way too many times to count

Why you gotta do that? (Why?)

You're the one who blew that

Make it tough to get it out

You're done, but I'm ready now

Why you gotta do that? (Why?)

You're the one who blew that

I really thought you knew

Every time you come you leave me blue

Somethin' inside me is swimmin'

Thought you did somethin' you didn't

Soon as I hit the beginnin'

Is when you reached the end

Somethin' inside me is swimmin'

Thought you did somethin' you didn't

Soon as I hit the beginnin'

Is when you reached the end

You get me up to let me down

Way too many times to count

Why you gotta do that? (Why?)

You're the one who blew that

Make it tough to get it out

You're done, but I'm ready now

Why you gotta do that? (Why?)

You're the one who blew that

I really thought you knew

Every time you come you leave me-

I really thought you knew

Every time you come you leave me blue



### Paradise



No matter where you go, you'll never have control

No one makes it out alive, no one makes it out alive

In paradise

Picture you in summertime

Drinking white wine, an empty girl

Told me that you'll see me

And I see ya and I really wanna believe ya, I do

Singing blues, no shoes on

Strumming in the sun and you've got your feet up

I remember when you used to tell me that you'd find your freedom

It was hard to believe ya

'Cause you never feel enough, it never fills you up

And if lying on an island is the closest that you'll come

Then run, go ahead, have fun, run

No matter where you go

(Doesn't matter where you go)

You'll never have control (no, no, no, no)

Woke up feeling paralyzed (yeah)

No one makes it out alive (yeah)

In paradise (yeah)

Picture me in the major leagues

Living in a dream that I created, mhm

I wrote my own books so I never had to read your pages

I've got no patience for that anyway

Sensations don't mean anything

If I can just have everything

Some days I think I'll run away

What would I even do if I made it?

I just keep on fading 'cause

I never feel enough, it never fills me up

I'm climbing up a giant rock, I'll never reach the top

But I can't stop, I can't stop, so

No matter where I go

(Doesn't matter where I go, no, no)

I'll never have control

(Never ever have it under)

Woke up feeling paralyzed (yeah)

No one makes it out alive (yeah)

In paradise (yeah)

Paralyzed (yeah)

No one makes it out alive (yeah)

In paradise (yeah)

With your band of brothers

Band-band of brothers

And when we pull up in the Phantom, the fans gon' love it

With your band of brothers

Band-band-band

With, with your band, band of brothers

And when we pull up in the Phantom, the fans gon' love it

Creamâfiveâfiveâfive stars

Cream up in the, rockârockârockstars

If I had it my way, I would sing all day

Me and those sirens so I'm putting in work

Mornings in the mosh, afternoons at the juice bar

Bentley coupÃ©, Maybach, haters, I rebute y'all

Little who-called, cigar may be a pre-roll

Fake room service knocking at the door, they wanted Migos

If it my way, I would play the reverend Al green

With Superfly playing on a 90 inch screen

Every chain would have rocks the size of gumballs

And my house would have Baeskis hung on the walls

My way like Sinatra, little butter on the mozza

Nothing but cream up in the crib, I mean lots of

Rubber bands stack, private securities

Smelting down gold, 24K for the purity

If I had it my way

Every day would feel like Friday

No cell phones would vibrate

Clutch on this SM58

Everything moving at my pace

Focus on the path that I pave for myself

I ain't worry 'bout no-one else

Nothing but a vision in my lane

All BFFs in MySpace

All VVS, my tough eight

Free (bitch) to do what I want to

Free like birds

Tryna be free like birds



### Stuck with Me



Now I'm feelin' guilty for it

Didn't wanna leave

I got caught up in the forest

Hangin' with the trees

Realized I'm less important

Than I thought I'd be

I'm not tellin' you for any certain reason, but

Now I'm feelin' guilty for it

I didn't wanna leave (no)

I got caught up in the forest

Hangin' with the trees (yeah, yeah)

Realized I'm less important (oh, yeah)

Than I thought I'd be, yeah

I'm not tellin' you for any certain reasons, but

I just want your empathy

Our lives keep on gettin' shorter

Losin' opportunity

There might be some other ways of lookin' at it, but

That's just what I see

I been gettin' over myself

Thinkin' about what you need

Then I realised that neither of us matter

What's reality? (yeah)

You are stuck with me, so

### Flowers



Every day, you want me to make

Something I hate, all for your sake

I'm such a fake, I'm just a doll

I'm a rip-off

And it turns you on

Bought some new clothes, then I

Polish my toes, then I

Powder my nose

In case you get close

(Get too close, baby)

Knock on your door, then I

Put on a show, then I

Gave you the floor

And you just froze

Every day, you want me to make

Something I hate, all for your sake

I'm such a fake, I'm just a doll

I'm a rip-off

And it turns you on

And it turns you on

And it turns you on

And it turns you on

Someone has to do it (do it)

So I guess I will (me)

You want more influence, and I

I can be your thrill

I can be your thrill

I can be your thrill (can I be yours?)

I can be your boy

And it turns you on

And it turns you on

And it turns you on

And it turns you on



### Compass



If I don't have you with me, I'm alone

You know I never know which way to go

I think I need you with me for all-time

When I need new direction for my mind

You listen to my lectures on the phone

You help me find the treasure in the hole

You'll tell me if I'm acting like a fool

I know that you're not something to lose, now

I've got something to confess

I keep you in my pocket to use

You're my only compass

I might get lost without you

(Could you tell me where to go?)

You're always there to help me when I'm down

I'm lucky you've been keeping me around

You're the star I look for every night

When it's dark, you'll stick right by my side

I've got something to confess

I keep you in my pocket to use (I keep you in my pocket)

You're my only compass (yeah)

I might get lost without you

Like a magnet

Hard to imagine ever-changing

Ever-changing my way, baby

Like a magnet

Can't help that I'm attracted to you, I am

Could you keep on guiding me? Please

I've got something to confess

I keep you in my pocket to use

You're my only compass

I might get lost without you (I might get lost without you)

I've got something to confess

I might get lost without you

You're my only compass

I might get lost without you





### Noise



Sick of being innocent

Sick of being ignorant too

I was in it for the thrill of it

'Til I started feelin' the truth

Why'd you ever make me choose?

I don't wanna be like you

I thought I knew you but

I never knew you would turn us into animals

I don't wanna be like you

Realized I'm living in hell when I was given the news

Why'd you let the evil win?

How'd you let him sell it to you?

I remember growing up mama used to sing me the blues

And now the kids are making noise

Just because it's something to do, to do, yeah

Why'd you ever make me choose?

I don't wanna be like you

I thought I knew you but I never knew you would turn us into animals

I don't wanna be like you

I don't wanna be like you

I don't wanna be like you

So now I'm second guessin' real life (ahh)

And if you left I still wouldn't feel right



### Heaven



There's something 'bout you, baby

There's something 'bout the way ya

Got me shaking like a seizure

No mistaking

I would die for your heaven

I could lie here forever

Every night we're together

If you'd like, I'll do whatever

You really want

You remind me of my mom

You make me feel like God

And I'm watchin' you fall from above

There's something 'bout you, baby

There's something 'bout the way ya

Got me shaking like a seizure

No mistakin' that I need ya

There's something 'bout you, baby

There's nothing like the way ya get me high

You got a heart from heaven, but you're burning like hell

Yeah, when I'm down you know how to lift me up

From the ground, through the clouds, to the sun

Tell me, how did I ever find you, babe?

Tell me now that you're never gonna run

There's something 'bout you, baby

There's something 'bout the way ya

Got me shaking like a seizure

No mistaking that I need ya

There's something 'bout you, baby

There's nothing like the way ya get me high

You've got a heart from heaven, but you're burning like hell

When I feel like I'm strangled

You treat me like an angel

Show me all different angles

And I never, ever felt that way, no

When you leave, I don't wanna try

And if you stick with me, I'll be fine

'Cause your love's rubbing off on me

Tell me, how'd you get so heavenly?

There's something 'bout you, baby

There's nothing like the way ya get me high

You've got a heart from heaven, but you're burning like hell



### Nervous



Maybe I shouldn't try to be perfect

I confess, I'm obsessed with the surface

In the end, if I fall or if I get it all

I just hope that it's worth it

Last year I fell flat on my face

And last month I knew somethin' should change

Last week I started over again

Ask me and I'll tell you how I've been

Mhm, don't get me started

You've got me nervous to speak

So I just won't say anything at all

I've got an urge to release

And you keep tellin' me to hold on

You've got me nervous to move

So I just won't give anything to you

You got me turnin' all around to be who you need me to

Should I be quiet?

Uh, come on, be silent

Uh, you know I'm tryin'

So don't say nothin'

Uh, tell me you trust me and

Kiss me and hug me, yeah

Well, I would do anything for ya

You just gotta love me and

I got an itch in my throat

I don't know which way to go

I keep on switchin', I know

I need a different approach

It's all because I wanna

Show you that I'm so capable

You've got me nervous to speak

So I just won't say anything at all

I've got an urge to release

And you keep tellin' me to hold on

You've got me nervous to move

So I just won't give anything to you

You got me turnin' all around to be who you need me to

Hush, baby, don't you say another word

Hush, baby, don't you say another word, be quiet

Hush, baby, don't you say another word

Hush, baby, when you do, I just get hurt

Come on, baby, don't you hurt me anymore

I'm not the same way that I was before

I got goosebumps all over me

When you're around, hard for me to breathe

Come on, baby, don't you do that anymore

It's not like the days have never felt so short

My nerves, they give me a sign

Tell me I'm not fine, mhm

You've got me nervous to speak

So I just won't say anything at all

I've got an urge to release

And you keep tellin' me to hold on

You've got me nervous to move

So I just won't give anything to you

You got me turnin' all around to be who you need me to

Hush, baby, don't you say another word

Hush, baby, don't you say another word, be quiet

Hush, baby, don't you say another word

Hush, baby, when you do, I just get hurt

Hush, baby

Hush, baby

Hush, baby

Hush, baby



### Sadderdaze



Dirty fingernails, same as your mind

But he could strum the guitar just fine

Every now and then he'd think about his life

Daydreamin' just to pass the the time

Now the sun is closer than it was before

Anyone who's anyone can feel it

Saturdays are not the same as they used to be

Sadder days, why do they keep on using me?

They keep on using me

Even as a child everyone would say

He was gonna be a star someday

Finally he found a way to reach the sky

But he didn't know what he'd find

Now the sun is closer than it was before

Anyone who's anyone can feel it, mmm

Saturdays are not the same as they used to be

Sadder days, why do they keep on using me?

They keep on using me

He's got a big head full of trash

And he talks down every chance he gets

He's a grown man with committable mistakes

Saturdays are not the same as they used to be

Sadder days, why do they keep on using me?

Saturdays are not the same as they used to be

Sadder days, why do they keep on using me?

Saturdays are not the same as they used to be

Sadder days, why do they keep on using me?

They keep on using me

They keep on using me

They keep on using me

They keep on using me

They keep on using me





### Beautiful Oblivion



I won't lie, I don't love you all the time, baby

I do sometimes but it's hard for me to fall in, baby

Put yourself down, have a little shame

Help me bring it back before we go away

We are all the same, we are all to blame

I don't need to say anybody's name

I'm a fucking heartache, I'm the alien

No, I'm not from Mars but I'm sure it's where I'll get

Our wars comin' first, Star Wars comin' next

It'll always be a mess, we were all forced to exist

I won't lie, I don't love you all the time, baby (I won't lie)

I do sometimes (yeah) but it's hard for me to fall in, baby (sometimes)

Yeah, look

24/7, I be planning shit

You call my line, I hit decline

You know I ain't shit and ancient

History told me "Play the game, shawty"

Cleopatra and Nefertiti, them titties have you left for dead

But when they see me gleaming on TV, I be in they head

Don't let me put my peenie on TV, that's a lot of head

Pornstar, pornstar, might as well be

'Cause my D, he a pornstar, say hi (hello)

I'm a stay fly (fellow)

I don't make time for hoes

Break her heart then I play my cello

Shalom, farewell, and chop

I'm in, I'm out, I hit, I'm out

I can't love with the doubt

We fight, we fuck, we fuck-fight

Fight, we fuck, I think it sucks, like

"Why we gotta talk so much?"

We switch it up, like we ain't gotta speak on none

We fuck, we fuck, we fuck, fuck, fuck and fuck!

Back in the day we would lay in the sun

Found out that I need a son, always had fun

Back in the day in the sun

Alâalways had fâback in the

I don't feel the way that I used to (anymore)

I don't ever wanna confuse you (anymore)

We were never on the same page (never ever)

And it might be time for a change

But what do I do if I lose you?

Do you remember when we were friends?

Nothing more than that, had to last

Told me that you had my back

I said, "I've got yours back

No matter what you do, no matter where you go"

I'll be there to let you know, I'll be true

No matter what's at stake, I won't ever lie or fake

We both know something's off, it's so easy to see

We know it's obvious but don't wanna believe it

Diâdidn't do the best but we got there first

Huddled up together when the weather got worse

There for each other for whatever like brothers so we gotta make it work

I don't feel the way that I used to (anymore)

I don't ever wanna confuse you (anymore)

We were never on the same page (never ever)

And it might be time for a change

But what do I do if I lose you?

Jesse, song for the bears, I swear, I'm sitting over here in the chairs

But I'm downstairs, I'm doing my hairs

Dude, your concert was off the chain, bro

I saw it in Brasil, it went freaking nuts

You are a freaking star

You know, dude, everybody in life has a place

And that's where your place is

In theâin the limelight, you know?

'Cause you're a freaking star, dude, let me tell ya

### Lost in Translation



I wonder if they see

That you don't belong to me

Wish that you would be mine

Mine, wish that you would be

I've been getting lost in translation

Trouble keeping up communication

We were having fun, now I can't wait to be done

It feels like I'm the only one that's sick of playing

Baby (baby), why you gotta keep me hanging?

It's like an apple of temptation, oh yeah

You let me get a bite, uh, out of sight, out of mind

Until I found a bruise on the other side

Time, oh

Do it to me one more

I've been getting lost in translation

Trouble keeping up communication

We were having fun, now I can't wait to be done

It feels like I'm the only one that's sick of playing

Sick, tired of people telling me, "Be patient"

Hey, trying to light the fire with no flame (no flame)

Uh, tying to figure out what you're saying to me

I wish I didn't need you to explain

Time, oh

Do it to me one more

Time, oh (do it to me, do it to me one more time)

Do it to me one more

I've been getting lost in translation

Trouble keepin' up communication

We were having fun, now I can't wait to be done

It feels like I'm the only one that's sick of playing

I've been getting lost in translation

Trouble keeping up communication

We were having fun, now I can't wait to be done

It feels like I'm the only one that's sick of playing



### Devil's Advocate



One, two, three, four

Ha ha

Na-na-na, na-na

Na-na, na-na, na

I trade the whip out for a bike, uh

Designer for some Nikes

Switch the stripper for a wife

Black tie for a white tee, uh

I've been moving lightspeed, lightspeed, lightspeed, lightspeed

Lightspeed, lightspeed, lightspeed, lightspeed

Look, I don't wanna try

Keep it cool like iced tea

So if I seem shy

It's 'cause you seem so shiesty

Sellin' what you buy, buy, buy

Just a product of the '90s

If you close your eyes

That's where you'll find me

I'm the devil's advocate

You don't know the half of it

Good luck tryna manage it

If a God is a dog, and a man is a fraud

Then I'm a lost cause

22s on the ride (ride)

Bring me back a five piece (five)

Same ticket for the rent, yeah

But I split it with a dime piece

Married to my friends

They don't always like me

I stay together for the kids, uh

I gotta do the right thing

I'm the devil's advocate

You don't know the half of it

Good luck tryna manage it

If a God is a dog, and a man is a fraud

Then I'm a lost cause





### Hell or High Water



I went through hell to get to high water

And now I'm trying not to drown

Each time I fail, it makes me try harder

I'll reach the stars next time around

I tripped and fell in the wishing well

I hit rock bottom, pennies kept landing face down

Lost all I wanted, looking for will

Desire burning

Well, I went through Hell to get to high water

And now I'm trying not to drown

Each time I fail, it makes me try harder

I'll reach the stars next time around



### Cherry Flavoured



Sweet and sour motivation

Wish I could keep concentration

I've been gettin' high

It's keeping me low now

I'm doin' it alone now

I think I gotta slow down

And I know I

I gotta take control now

But I sold my soul a long time ago

I feel like a ghost now

Cherry flavored conversations with you

Got me hanging on

Down to Earth from all the waiting

Take me somewhere beyond

I've been gettin' high

But I don't ever stay up, no no

I feel like I'm fading, yeah

Give me stimulation now

Get me to the next level

Come on, give me levitation, God

Slow dancin' with the devil

Sent my soul on a little vacation

I've been gettin' high

It's keeping me low now

I'm doin' it alone now

I think I gotta slow down

I know I

I gotta take control now

But I sold my soul a long time ago

I feel like a ghost now

Cherry flavored conversations

Lover boy

Body toy

Cold, cold, body toy

Cold, cold, I tried to drown

All the pills, I wish they'd

Lover boy

Cold





### BooHoo



Boohoo

I heard what's happening lately, why I'm so down

But we're still happening, baby, right here, right now

I heard what's happening, why I'm so down

But we're still happening, baby, right here, right now

You hate it when I overreact

I wish I didn't act like that

I always feel under attack

You keep telling me to relax

Doctor got me keepin' my cool (my cool)

I still don't wanna follow the rules

I already feel like a tool (a tool)

So tell me what you want me to do (ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)

Boohoo

I heard what's happening lately, why I'm so down

But we're still happening, baby, right here, right now

I heard what's happening, why I'm so down

But wÐµ're still happening, baby, right herÐµ, right now

Call her Alexander 'cause I treat her like McQueen

Sleepin' in a palace livin' every girl's dream (ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)

She knows that she's magic, doesn't worry 'bout her status

Just as good as you imagine but it's so hard to believe

Shotgun ridin' with me, whip don't need no gasoline

YSL, gave her those shoes and I bought my CÃ©line's, yeah

Anywhere I take her, everybody wants a piece

Look, I don't even blame 'em, that's my baby, she'll make anyone smile

Boohoo

I heard what's happenin' lately (yeah), why I'm so down

But we're still happenin', baby

Right here, right now (right here, right now, right now)

I heard what's happenin' (I heard)

Why I'm so down (I'm so down)

We're still happenin', baby, right here, right now



### Silver Lining



You had your heart on your sleeve the last time

Took it so seriously the last time

Gave everybody a piece the last time

Yeah, you said it would be the last time

If you find that silver lining

You should know what that means

You've been moving fast, splitting at the seams

If you find that silver lining, you're already in deep

There's another piece, that was buried underneath

You were out of your league the last time

Didn't expect 'em to see your bad side

You told 'em they could believe in you (believe in you)

Now you just gotta believe it too

Oh woah, yeah

If you find that silver lining

You should know what that means

You've been moving fast, splitting at the seams

If you find that silver lining, you're already in deep

This could be your last hope, that might be all you need

If you find that silver lining, you're already in deep

This could be your last hope





### Tobacco Sunburst



Left with a black eye

That was the worst I've felt

In a long, long time

I caught a red eye

Back to the West side

In the Tobacco Sunburst sky

Looked in those brown eyes

I thought I found myself

Damn, it's been a while

Looking in your blue eyes

Never knew I'd lose myself

In the Tobacco Sunburst sky, I

I

I

Oh, I

I'll turn a blind eye

Looking on the bright side now

Hell, I'll give it a try

Looking in your green eyes

Never knew I'd need your help

I don't wanna wait any more time (any more time)

Sick of watchin' those flames burn bright (burn bright)

I don't wanna wait any more time (any more time)

Sick of watchin' those days roll on by



### Middle of Somewhere



I was on the outside looking in

Now I'm on the inside trying to stay

Out of my head

I need peace of mind

Grew up pretty fast

Good things never last

You gotta live before you learn

Now I'm somewhere far

Away from where I started

With no point of return

But I'm turning

I was on the outside looking in

Now I'm on the inside trying to stay

Out of my head

I need peace of mind

Landed in the middle of somewhere

With you

Now you're stranded in the middle of somewhere, oh yeah

Too

Always runnin' away

Looking for an escape

Everyone is an alien

When you're tryin' to find your place (tryin' to find your place)

Trying to stay out

Trying to stay out of my head

Trying to stay out

NÃ£o me leve a mal, mas eu nÃ£o minto

Sempre tÃ´ blefando por nÃ³s dois

Me desculpe, mas nÃ£o jogo limpo

NÃ£o arranque palavras de mim

Se Ã© papo de Rambo e Jungle

Eu posso te mostrar como eu te amo

Se tudo der certo, ainda te lambo

Posso te ensinar a danÃ§ar mambo

Acendemo um mango haze

Qual foi a Ãºltima vez que tu fez uma coisa pela tua primeira vez?

Tipo nudes, ficÃ§Ãµes, falso amor, facÃ§Ãµes, afters, ratÃµes

Toda noite, meu amor, eu peÃ§o que vocÃª me mude

Em fraÃ§Ãµes, amor e noÃ§Ãµes, actors, aÃ§Ãµes

Toda noite, meu amor, eu peÃ§o que vocÃª me mande

Nudes, ficÃ§Ãµes, falso amor em fraÃ§Ãµes, afters

Toda noite, meu amor, eu peÃ§o que vocÃª me mude

Toda noite, meu amor, eu peÃ§o que me mande nudes

Toda noite, meu amor, eu peÃ§o que vocÃª me



Touch me like the words fly in your head

Touch me like you never touch before

Feel my body in the arms of perfection

Let's do your imagination

Say my name if you wanna play

I don't need permission

Make me your decision

Say my name if you wanna play

I don't need permission

Make me your decision



### GÃªmeos Gustah



Tem uma santa e uma diaba

Uma veste Louis, outra veste Prada

Uma delas mente, e uma delas mata

E elas dizem: baby, ninguÃ©m manda nessa raba

Eu te disse que eu sou bruxo, amor, abracadabra

Deixa eu provar sua boca de sabor jabuticaba

Sobe na Rocinha, que nÃ£o tem conto de fada

Vai eu, vocÃª, a Madonna e a Lady Gaga, Ã©

Todos sabem meu nome, vejo flash, sorri e acene

'Leque, cÃª nÃ£o Ã© o Super-Homem

Toda noite um novo game

Toda noite cidadÃ£o dÐµ nome

E como disse o Froid, o XamÃ£zin esquizo-paranoide

AliÐµns no meu Monza, ouvi Pink Floyd

Eram deuses, astronautas, espermatozoides

Vampiros vagando pela Void

Querem meu peru, sÃ³ que eu sou Android

Dois telefonema, essa porra toda explode

Bonde de Bangu, turma do pagode

Dois telefonema, essa porra toda explode

Mano, vai tomar no cu, para de neurose

Pablo Escobar tÃ¡ na vinganÃ§a do bigode

Salve, Zona Sul, turma do pagode

Um telefonema, essa porra toda explode

Antes do seu mundo se acabar

Eu quero transar com vocÃªs, nÃ³s trÃªs

Vejo que nÃ£o posso confiar

Mas te quero pro meu prazer, Ãªh

Antes dessa mÃºsica acabar

Eu quero transar com vocÃªs, nÃ³s trÃªs

Vejo, Ã© inevitÃ¡vel confiar

Mas eu te quero mesmo assim (pra mim)

Yo, tem uma santa e uma diaba

Uma mete muito, e a outra diz que Ã© braba

Uma veste Gucci, a outra vem pelada

E elas dizem: porra, esse XamÃ£ nÃ£o vale nada

Sou Lord Voldemort, amor, abracadabra

Ãndio night wolf, mata Dolp de porrada

Sobe na Rocinha, aqui nÃ£o tem conto de fada

Vai eu, vocÃª e minha carteira recheada, Ã©

Todos sabem meu nome, Zona Oeste, cidadÃ£o Kane

'Leque, cÃª nÃ£o Ã© o Super-Homem

Muito menos Clark Kent

DJ Gustta, meu nome nÃ£o Ã© Jhony

Esquizo-paranoide, nossa vida em foto polaroid

Tua vida Ã© um som do Pink Floyd

Eu fumando atÃ© o Ãºltimo acorde

Um telefonema e essa porra toda explode

Antes do seu mundo se acabar

Eu quero transar com vocÃªs, nÃ³s trÃªs

Vejo que nÃ£o posso confiar

Mas te quero pro meu prazer, Ãªh

Antes dessa mÃºsica acabar

Eu quero transar com vocÃªs, nÃ³s trÃªs

Vejo, Ã© inevitÃ¡vel confiar

Mas eu te quero mesmo assim (pra mim)





### LeÃ£o MarÃ­lia MendonÃ§a, Neo Beats



Mas se quiser me olhar

Como um quadro sem explicaÃ§Ã£o

TÃ´ de um jato lunar

Na capital de SÃ£o SebastiÃ£o

Que o Sol da manhÃ£ te dissolva

Seu vampiro de filmes pastelÃ£o

Mas quem vai nos julgar?

Sou seu despenteado leÃ£o

Sei que cÃª me entende bem

Sempre foge quando namora

Se vocÃª nÃ£o ama ninguÃ©m

Por que tÃ¡ me escutando agora?

Sua linda, tÃ£o louca, minha Mona Lisa

Tira a minha roupa, me fascina

Me assassina, me beija na boca

Minha mulher, menina

Me ensina a ser vida louca

Teu olho piscina

Me afoga e faz boca a boca

Renova minha rima

Vem de garfo que hoje Ã© sopa, menina

Mas se quiser ficar

Eu disfarÃ§o e agarro sua mÃ£o

VilÃ£o particular

Sou um blefe de um filme de aÃ§Ã£o

Se eu subo nesse palco aqui

Foi Deus que me criou assim

E os holofotes vÃªm ao meu encontro

Ã que eu te amo e nem te conto

NÃ£o, nÃ£o posso ser seu santo

Sou fato ou hipÃ³tese

Sou rei, cigano ou nÃ´made

Desculpe esse meu jeito soberano

Mas hoje Ã© por vocÃª que eu canto

E Ã© por vocÃª que eu canto

Sei que cÃª me quer tambÃ©m

MarÃ­lia leoa gostosa

Posso te ligar, meu bem?

Que que cÃª tÃ¡ fazendo agora?

TÃ£o lindo, tÃ£o louco, meu grande amigo

Depois de vocÃª os outros sÃ£o outros

CÃª tÃ¡ fodido

Vamos fazer amor

Cantar um sertanejo antigo

E beijar na boca, amor

Pode ser atÃ© que vocÃª nÃ£o me dÃª moral

AtÃ© me ver no espaÃ§o pela banca de jornal

Mas se quiser me olhar

Como um quadro sem explicaÃ§Ã£o

TÃ´ de um jato lunar

Na capital de SÃ£o SebastiÃ£o

Ayy, diga-me com quem samba, eu seguirei teus pÃ©s

Diga-me quem tu amas, eu te direi quem Ã©s

Me diz como se diz eu te amo depois de 2010

Tenho aptidÃ£o pra juntar amores que desaparecem rapidÃ£o

Baby, vocÃª nÃ£o me conhece, vem, me passa a visÃ£o

Que me ama, nÃ£o me esquece, disse a solidÃ£o

Num eclipse, um dia 'cÃª me disse que

RoubÃ¡vamos um banco e morrÃ­amos no Civic

O amor Ã© cego e libriano Ã© sensitive

No relacionamento abusivo que vivi e morri e chorei de ti

Diga-me quem fui, quem sou, te direi que nÃ£o presto

Rimas de Rambo, Ã©ramos reis e comÃ­amos resto, me diz

VocÃª sabe, baby, que eu nem sou tÃ£o bom assim

Me diz o que 'cÃª quer de mim

Te vejo ali depois do fim

Por nossas contas nÃ£o te devo nada, nada

Me equilibrando apÃ³s o fim

A vida Ã© uma piada (ha, ha, ha)

NÃ³s dois, nÃ£o mais

Adeus, minha pequena

Meus versos sujos nÃ£o sÃ£o mais poemas

Que pena (que pena)

De luar, Libra

Em nome de Deus, me dÃª alguma alternativa plena

Dois lados da mesma moeda, do mesmo poema

Que pena, que pena

E que ninguÃ©m manda na sua bu...

Me apelidou com 17 palavrÃ£o

Eu canto tudo, eu danÃ§o tudo

Eu leio mapas, eu crio mundos

NÃ£o sei se sacas meu ego burro

Quer apostar que eu escrevi isso tudo

Pra vocÃª? Eh, eh

Eu trouxe um sol pra vocÃª, eh, eh

SÃ³ me esqueci de acender, bae, bae

Me empresta o seu isqueiro aÃª

Mas tu Ã© maluca, maluca

Maluca demais

Virginiana maluca, maluca

Maluca demais

Standing in halls where the great men shine

They were your dreams and the reason I mind

You would have held me back and you would have let me go

You would have told me no, you would have told me yes

Would have stayed the night, then we'd probably have sex

She got, she got, she got

Her own reasons

For talking to me

She don't, she don't, she don't

Give a fuck

About what I need



And I can't tell you why

Because my brain can't equate it

Tell me your lies

Because I just can't face it



It's you, it's you

It's you

It's you, it's you

It's you



I won't, I won't, I won't

Cover my scars

I'll let them bleed

So my silence

So my silence won't

Be mistaken for peace

Am I wrong for wanting us to make it?



Tell me your lies

Because I just can't face it



It's you, it's you

It's you

It's you, it's you

It's you



Could it be that it's a lesson?

That I never had to learn

I looked at it like a blessing

And now it's just a curse

I don't know why

I don't know why

You, it's you



It's you, it's you

It's you

It's you, it's you

It's you



### BeFoUr



I've done this before

Not like this

I don't drink to get drunk

I feel all the right funk

If there's something I want

I'll take all the right wrongs, now

I'm gonna stay in my zone

I'm tired of picking that bone

And I can't be bothered to fight it no more, no

Numb on a roof

Set it on fire

Just to give me proof

I'm living on a wire

Numb on a roof

Set it on fire

Just to give me proof

I'm living on a wire

So say what you wanna say, what you wanna

So say what you wanna say, what you gotta say, now

So say what you wanna say, what you want

Shame is you won't say that to my face

I've done this before

Not like this, not like this

Time for me to move up

So many hours have gone

Heart beats the pump of my blood

No strings for you to pull on

You've got your tongue in your cheek

So pardon if I don't speak

Can't tune my chords into your songs, no

Now I'm on the roof

Set it on fire

Just to give me proof

I'm living on a wire

So say what you wanna say, what you wanna

So say what you wanna say, what you gotta say, now

So say what you wanna say

So say what you wanna say, what you want

Shame is you won't say that to my face

I've done this before

Not like this, not like this

Flashing lights

So say what you wanna say, what you wanna

So say what you wanna say, what you gotta say, now

So say what you wanna say, what you want

Shame is you won't say that to my face

So say what you wanna say, what you wanna (so say what you wanna say)

So say what you wanna say, what you gotta say, now

So say what you wanna say, what you want

Shame is you won't say that to my face

I've done this before

Not like this (not like this) not like this (not like this)

I've done this before

Not like this (not like this) not like this (not like this)

She puts her spirit in a nightcap

She always knows where the crowd's at

She puts her mouth round the cigarette

I put it out cause she likes that

She always dances when it's raining

"Aye, when's it starting baby?"

She looks at me like she's waiting

Making time go slow when they show her the table

Bright lights, she's fading

Feels right, she's crazy

Bright lights, she's fading

Feels right, she's crazy

She wants somebody to love

To hold her

She wants somebody to love

In the right way

She wants somebody to love

To kiss her

She wants somebody to love

In the right way

She's crying out that she loves me

Holding my hands so I won't leave

Cause baby don't wanna be lonely

She says "I just want you to hold me"

Bright lights, she's fading

Feels right, she's crazy

Bright lights, she's fading

Feels right, she's crazy

She wants somebody to love

To hold her

She wants somebody to love

In the right way

She wants somebody to love

To kiss her

She wants somebody to love

In the right way

In the right way

In the right way

In the right way, in the, in the, in the right way way

In the wrong, wrong, in the right way

In the right way, in the, in the, in the right way way

In the wrong, wrong, in the right way

In the wrong way, in the, in the, in the right way way

In the wrong, wrong, in the right way

In the wrong way, in the, in the, in the right way way

In the wrong, wrong

She wants somebody to love

To hold her

She wants somebody to love

In the right way

She wants somebody to love

To hold her

She wants somebody to love

In the right way

She wants somebody to love

To kiss her

She wants somebody to love

In the right way

We're so late nights

Red eyes, amnesia, on ice

Late nights, red eyes, amnesia, I need ya



Right now I can't see straight

Intoxicated it's true

When I'm with you

I'm buzzing and I feel laced

I'm coming from a different phase

When I'm with you



Another away now

Like we're supposed to do

Take you to the back now

I'd take a shot for you

Wasted every night

Gone for every song

Faded every night

Dancing all night long



Drunk all summer

Drunk all summer

We be drunk all summer

Drinking and flowing and rolling

We're falling down



We're so late nights

Red eyes, amnesia

I need ya



Right now I'm emotional

I lose control, when I'm with you

I hope I haven't said too much

Guess I always push my luck when I'm with you



Another away now

Like we're supposed to do

Take you to the back now

I'd take a shot for you

Wasted every night

Gone for every song

Faded every night

Dancing all night long



Drunk all summer

Drunk all summer

We be drunk all summer

Drinking and flowing and rolling

We're falling down



We're so late nights

Red eyes, amnesia, on ice

Late nights, red eyes

Amnesia, I need ya



Drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk

Drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk

Drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk

Drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk

Drunk all summer

Can your heart be mine in search

Cause I have no time to help you find

All the words

Melodies and memories

Stories that sound absurd

I will tell no lies

As long as you look me in the eyes

I'll go wherever you are

I'll follow behind

Heard about all the things you done

And all the walls you've been in

Heard about all the love you lost

It was over before it began

Heard about all the miles you've gone

Just to gone to start again

Heard about all the things you've been through

It sounds like you need a friend, a friend

Please don't wait

I'm not coming home tonight

I wanna love you but I can't

As long as you look me in the eyes

I'll go wherever you are

I'll follow behind

Heard about all the things you done

And all the walls you've been in

Heard about all the love you lost

It was over before it began

Heard about all the miles you've gone

Just to gone to start again

Heard about all the things you've been through

It sounds like you need a friend, a friend

I never doubted myself

But I doubted you

I'm tired of looking by myself

And not with you

Heard about all the things you done

And all the walls you've been in

Heard about all the love you lost

It was over before it began

Heard about all the miles you've

Just to gone to start again

Heard about all the things you've been through

It sounds like you need a friend, a friend

Oh, we were not on the same place

Show me in the same light

Feels right when we take flight

Clothes off 'cause she's so soft

This ain't a fair fight, yeah

Wanna shed light on the subject

I'll get her wetter than ever

Four letters are never the question

She likes when I'm messy

And I like when she's undressing

You're looking in the wrong place for my love

Don't think because you're with me this is real

You're looking in the wrong place for my love (my love)

Don't stop what you're doing 'cause I like how you're doing it

Here with you 'cause you got the right vibe

Seems like you probably got a dope mind

But it's gotta be the right time

We're only good for the night time

I see through your demeanor

Baby, I'm a pleaser

I go out my way to treat you

But I can't be your teacher

'Cause I'm a problem with problems

I know who I am and I'm not no good

You can have me tonight or never, I thought you understood

Baby, some people are meant to be loved and others just make it

So take what I'm willing to give and love it or hate it

You're looking in the wrong place for my love

Don't think because you're with me this is real (oh-oh)

You're looking in the wrong place for my love

Don't stop what you're doing 'cause I like how you're doing it, no

Don't stop what you're doing

Don't stop what you're doing (don't stop, uh)

I don't, I don't really know (uh-oh)

I don't, I don't really care (don't stop, uh)

Maybe keep it on the low (don't stop, uh)

With stories that I don't wanna share (I don't, uh, don't stop)

You're looking in the wrong place for my love (for my love)

Don't think because you're with me this is real

You're looking in the wrong place for my love (my love)

Don't stop what you're doing 'cause I like how you're doing it, no

You're looking in the wrong place for my love

Don't think because you're with me this is real

You're looking in the wrong place for my love (for my love)

Don't stop what you're doing 'cause I like how you're doing it



### fOoL fOr YoU



This love is tainted

I need you and I hate it

You're caught between a dream and a movie scene

In a way, you know what I mean

When the darts just miss, I just can't resist it

Cause I'm a fool for you and the things you do

Cause I'm a fool for you and the things, the things you do

The things you do, the things you do

When you're looking like this

I just can't resist it

I know sometimes I hide it

But I can't this time cause it's gonna defeat me

But if you won't believe me, believe me

Cause I'm a fool for you and the things you do

Cause I'm a fool for you and the things, the things you do

The things you do, the things you do

I know, I know given a chance I'd do it again

Cause I can't help myself

Cause I can't stop myself

I just love being a fool for you-oh-oh

Cause I'm a fool for you and the things you do

Cause I'm a fool for you and the things, the things you do

The things you do, the things you do

This love is tainted

She is the life of the party

Don't stick that knife in my body

It's something she always wanted for a good cause

You're doing a good job

And we're off where the wind blows

And I don't care where we go

Just like the ocean you change, water sea

They don't know what I know

How long I've had to hold

You're like a commotion all because of me

So take it off

Let's break down all of our walls

Right now I wanna see it all, oh oh

I don't wanna cool off

So let's cross the lines we lost

Right now I wanna see it all, oh oh

You were right on border

Gimme all of this

Gimme all of you

Don't follow me

Don't lean on me

Guilty for insanity

Live like a movie

Change the scene

Taste your sweet profanity it's all for a good cause

Think you're doing a good job

They don't know what I know

How long I've had to hold

You're life a commotion

All because of me

So take it off

Let's break down all of our walls

Right now I wanna see it all, oh oh

I don't wanna cool off

So let's cross the lines we lost

Right now I wanna see it all, oh oh

You were right on border

[Verse 1]

My luck's on the game, can't find a way through

Don't know how many times I had to say this to you

This ain't my scene, this wasn't my dream

It was all yours, of course

I got caught up in this game and you know I won't say names

Of who's to blame



[Pre-Chorus]

I wonât point any fingers, I wonât say it was you

I'll let life take its time, and in time, you'll see the truth

I won't ask any questions, I won't say it was you

I'll let life take its time, and in time, you'll see the truth



[Chorus]

See the truth, see the truth

See the truth, see the truth

See the truth, see the truth

See the truth, see the truth



[Verse 2]

My own mind was in the way, front seat, new view

Don't know how many times I've had to talk you through

My dreams, new scenes with enemies

I got caught up in this game, again

### lUcOzAdE



I'm sipping pink Lucozade

We're blazing on that new found haze

I'm seeing in the blacks and grays

I'm hoping that the basket sways

Left to right, sit and talk shit all night

Does that make it right for smoke?

Maybe, or am I just seeing shit?

Seeing the pain inside this house of fear

You don't even wanna know about the things I hear

Quick fix, headlines shine bright, you're the fuckin' deal

I'm just wishing it's ambition that got you

Your position

You'll be fishing for far too long

You're the bad guy in this movie

And I ain't wrong, I don't breathe the pollution

And the only solution is making shit confusing

And it ain't about whose winning or losing

But the path that you're choosing

Time heals pain and promotes self-soothing

When the scares are gone you can't see bruising

Wanna take these watches, chains and gold rings

I'm getting caught up in the feelings that they bring

A lack of sanity, losing touch with reality

Smoking too much, it's starting to fog up my clarity

Traveling in the day but you're still looking far to me

Bulls eye, you the dot to me

Emotions splattered seeing padding

Can't even begin to spot 'em

I'm sad about shit that never happened

No lies in my eyes, nothing but truth will lay in my mouth

I'm tryna fuckin' scream but the words won't come out

Ooh-ahh

Tryna fuckin' scream but the words won't come out

She's older, I told her

We ain't meant to be

It takes two not three, but I'm here any way

I hope he's leaving soon

Started not to see the elephant in this room

Disguised as your perfume

But the smell of it consumes, it takes all my mind

You can search the world but you will never find

I see everything you've done to me

Be there, you run me

I don't need to pace, I don't need the stamina

If this shit was it, girl, I probably would be runnin' from ya

Kept running

Outwit, 'cause you cunnin'

That outfit 'cause you're stunnin'

Begging 'cause you've choosen me

Got me feeling some type of way I can't explain

The fuck is going on?

I think I got it wrong

When I told you I was over you, or were you under me?

I can taste it on your mouth

And I can't leave it

Can't you see?

We can work this something out

And I'm believin'

You get off on me

I, I, I

I just wanna watch you when you take it off

I just wanna watch you when you take it off

Take off all your clothes

Baby just take it off

Take it off, take it off

Push me up against the wall

Let's get naked

And explore our inner secrets

For what it is, it's what it is

In the clouds where the angels sing

In her eyes where I wanna be

And her smile is all I see

She knows I need her loving

She knows I need her touching

She plays with my heart and emotion

I give her my love and devotion

She gives thoughts and a notion

I need her body, it needs me too



I need somebody to

Love me blue



I've been doing it wrong for too long

I said I've been at it wrong for too long

I've been doing it wrong for too long



In the clouds where the angels sing

It's her smile, yeah it's all I see

In her eyes, where I wanna be

She knows I need her loving

### BRIGHT



II found my life in between shots and getting high

The cage I was in fell away when she asked me to dance again

I found my life in between a first kiss and a last goodbye

The dust settled down, now I can see through the crowd

I'm loving the colorway

Surrounding your colored eyes

Though she is the kryptonite

She stays in my crib tonight

I light her like dynamite

Load her like gigabyte

Turn out the fucking lights

I wanna see you bright

I wanna see you bright

I wanna see you bright

I wanna see you bright

I wanna see you

For the love in my mind

Love for the bass

She likes getting high just for the day

She's different in night, she knows what I say

Free of the flash, dirt on your shoes

I don't know you

I'm loving the colorway

Surrounding your colored eyes

Though she is the kryptonite

She stays in my crib tonight

I light her like dynamite

Load her like gigabyte

Turn out the fucking lights

I wanna see you bright

I wanna see you bright

I wanna see you bright

I wanna see you bright

I wanna see you bright

I found my life in between shots and getting high

The cage I was in fell away when she asked me to dance again

I wanna see you bright

I wanna see you bright

I wanna see you bright

I wanna see you bright

I wanna see you bright

I wanna see you bright

I wanna see you bright

I wanna see you



### LIKE I WOULD



Hey what's up, it's been a while

Talking 'bout it's not my style

Thought I'd see what's up, while I'm lighting up

It's cold-hearted, cold-hearted

Know it's late but I'm so wired

Saw your face and got inspired

Guess you let it go, now you're good to go

It's cold-hearted, cold-hearted

Oh, oh

It's probably gonna sound wrong

Promise it won't last long

Oh, oh

If we can never go back

Thought you'd like to know that

He, won't touch you like I do

He, won't love you like I would

He don't know your body

He don't do you right

He won't love you like I would

Love you like I would

Talkin' don't want me, cause I want you

Been thinkin' it over, but I'm through

So stop wasting all my time, messing with my mind

It's cold-hearted, cold-hearted

Oh, oh

It's probably gonna sound wrong

Promise it won't last long

Oh, oh

If we can never go back

Thought you'd like to know that

He, won't touch you like I do

He, won't love you like I would

He don't know your body

### SHE DONâT LOVE ME



I, I need you

I, I don't

I question myself all the time, asking what

I don't know

It's kinda hard to walk right

When you're walking on my left

With your high heels on

And your sexy ass dress

I see you talking on your phone, phone

Wish I could get you on your own, own

But I've seen you gone over love

I think I know she don't love me

That's why I fuck around

I think I know she don't love me

That's why I fuck around

I want you

Your body

I want you

Your body on top of mine

I, I want you

I, I don't

I question myself all the time, asking why

I don't know

It's kinda hard to walk right

When you're walking on my left

With your high heels on

And your sexy ass dress

I see you talking on your phone, phone

Wish I could get you on your own, own

But I've seen you gone over love

I think I know she don't love me

That's why I fuck around

I think I know she don't love me

That's why I fuck around

I want you

Your body

I want you

Your body on top of mine

Should we wait 'til the morning?

See it loud in your eyes

Can't escape what I'm feeling

Your body on top of mine

I think I know she don't love me

That's why I fuck around

I think I know she don't love me

That's why I fuck around

I want you

Your body on top of mine

I want you

Your body on top of mine



### DO SOMETHING GOOD



I smoke two joints before I play video games

Then I get ten thousand points

I flew around this planet only yesterday

Because I am an alien

I seen this galaxy and Milky Way

I even watched the sun (watched the sun)

I got a J givin' me my light away

Because I don't get drunk

Let's do something good today, before it's too late

Let's do something good today, before it's too late, this is our day

Let's do something good today, before it's too late (before it's too late)

Said let's do something good today, before it's too late, before it's too late

Three more joints and I'm still playing video games

Can't even count the points

Play it 'til my fingers bleed

Who said that tomorrow will be guaranteed?

Let's do something good today, before it's too late (before it's too late)

Let's do something good today, before it's too late, this is our day

Let's do something good today, before it's too late (before it's too late)

Said let's do something good today, before it's too late, before it's too late

And then we fly away

And we ain't running out of fuel

I'm running off of you

I'm running off of you (you)

And then we fly away

And then we fly away

And we ain't running out of fuel

I'm running off of you, I'm running off of you

And then we fly

Let's do something good today, before it's too late

Let's do something good today, before it's too late, this is our day

Let's do something good today, before it's too late

Said let's do something good today, before it's too late, before it's too late



### GOLDEN



It goes and it's golden like sands of time

I hope and I hope you'll still be fine

I know that it's bright, look through the light and see, it's meant to be

I know that it's bright, look through the light and see, it's meant to be



Every single jigsaw piece

Seems to be you complete



The choices we make change the path that we take

But I know

That somewhere out there there's a path that we chose

There's a life that we share, there's a love and it grows



It goes and it's golden like sands of time

I hope and I hope you'll still be fine

I know that it's bright

Look through the light and see, it's meant to be



Every single jigsaw piece



The choices we make change the path that we take

But I know

That somewhere out there there's a path that we chose

There's a life that we share, there's a love and it grows



Cause it grows and it grows

And I hope that you know

Cause it grows and it grows

I know that it's bright, look through the light and see



The choices we make change the path that we take

But I know

That somewhere out there there's a path that we chose

There's a life that we share, there's a love and it grows





### I don't wanna live forever



Been sitting eyes wide open behind these four walls, hoping you'd call

It's just a cruel existence like there's no point hoping at all

Baby, baby, I feel crazy, up all night, all night and every day

Give me something, oh, but you say nothing

What is happening to me?

I don't wanna live forever, 'cause I know I'll be living in vain

And I don't wanna fit wherever

I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home

I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home

I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home

I'm sitting eyes wide open and I got one thing stuck in my mind

Wondering if I dodged a bullet or just lost the love of my life

Baby, baby, I feel crazy, up all night, all night and every day

I gave you something, but you gave me nothing

What is happening to me?

I don't wanna live forever, 'cause I know I'll be living in vain

And I don't wanna fit (fit, babe) wherever (wherever)

I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home

I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home

I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home

I've been looking sad in all the nicest places

Baby, baby, I feel crazy

I see you around in all these empty faces

All night, all night and every day

I've been looking sad in all the nicest places

Give me something, oh, but you say nothing

Now I'm in a cab, I tell 'em where your place is

What is happening to me?

I don't wanna live forever, 'cause I know I'll be living in vain

And I don't wanna fit wherever

I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home

I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home

I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home

I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home

I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home

I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home

Until you come back home



## Icarus Fall



### Let Me



Sweet baby, our sex has meaning

Know this time you'll stay 'til the morning

Duvet days and vanilla ice cream

More than just one night together exclusively

Baby, let me be your man

So I can love you (I can love you)

And if you let me be your man

Then I'll take care of you, you

For the rest of my life, for the rest of yours

For the rest of my life, for the rest of yours

For the rest of ours

We're drinking the finest label

Dirty dancing on top of the table

Long walks on the beach in April (beach in April)

Yeah, I promise, darling, that I'll be faithful (be faithful)

Baby, let me be your man (let me be your man)

So I can love you (I can love you)

And if you let me be your man (let me be your man)

Then I'll take care of you (I can love you)

For the rest of my life, for the rest of yours

For the rest of my life, for the rest of yours

For the rest of ours

Give me your body and let me love you like I do

Come a little closer and let me do those things to you

This feeling will last forever, baby, that's the truth

Let me be your man so I can love you

Baby, let me be your man (let me be your man)

So I can love you (I can love you)

And if you let me be your man (let me be your man)

Then I'll take care of you, you (I can love you)

For the rest of my life (for the rest of my life)

For the rest of yours (for the rest of yours)

For the rest of my life (for the rest of my life)

For the rest of yours (for the rest of yours)

For the rest of ours (for the rest of ours)



### Natural



It's just like breathin', speakin'

When we touch, like a force of nature

Not just a feelin', let's believe it

The birth of love like a force of nature

Undeniable (it's our love)

Unforgettable (it's our love)

Nothing compares to when

I feel you on my skin

It feels so natural, natural

When we come together

Like a force of nature

It feels so natural, natural

When we come together

Like a force of nature

When we come together, together, together

When we come together, together, together

Pure heart, deeper

Beautiful, like the bluest ocean

Like a wave, we broke down

The barriers, like the bluest ocean

It's incredible (it's our love)

Unforgettable (it's our love)

Nothing compares to when

I feel you on my skin

It feels so natural, natural

When we come together

Like a force of nature

It feels so natural, natural

When we come together

Like a force of nature

When we come together, together, together

When we come together, together, together

Like a hurricane (it's our love)

Like a hurricane (it's our love)

Like a hurricane

When we come together

Like a hurricane (it's our love)

Like a hurricane (it's our love)

Like a hurricane

When we come together

It feels so natural, natural

When we come together

Like a force of nature

It feels so natural, natural

When we come together

Like a force of nature

Let's come together, come together

Right now, right now

Let's come together, come together

Right now, right now

Come together, together

Right now



### Back To Life



What if I changed my mind

What if I said it's over

I been flying so long

Can't remember what it was like to be sober

What if I lost my lives?

What if I said "Game over"?

What if I forget my lies?

And I lose all my composure

Honestly, she's the only one

That's watching over me

Gives me oxygen when it gets hard to breathe

And if I'm wrong or right

She's always on my side

And if I lose the fight

I know she'll bring me back

Bring me back, bring me back to life

Bring me back

Bring me back, bring me back to life

What if we never met

What if I never saw her

'Cause I've been burning up for so long

In a world that just keeps getting colder

Honestly, she's the only one

That's watching over me

Gives me oxygen when it gets hard to breathe

And if I'm wrong or right

She's always on my side

And if I lose the fight

I know she'll bring me back

Bring me back, bring me back to life

Bring me back

Bring me back, bring me back to life

Nobody does this like you

I've been around the world

I seen a lot of girls

I been a lot of places

I seen a lot of faces

Nobody does this like you

Honestly she's the only one

That's watching over me

Gives me oxygen when it gets hard to breathe

And if I'm wrong or right

She's always on my side

And if I lose the fight

I know she'll bring me back to life



### Common



Always lookin' out behind my fences

Always felt isolated, oh-oh-oh

I don't know why I was so defensive

I'll find a way to let you in

I will die if I don't try

Damned if I ask why

This is somethin' real

This is somethin' right

Never been in love

Never felt at all until now

As I lay here in your bed

I need you on my chest

To warm me all the time

To tickle with your breath

Sweetin' on your lips

There ain't nothin' common 'bout us

In this ordinary world

Where nothin' is enough

Everything is grey

Mistake your love for lust

When I hold you in my arms

There ain't nothin' common 'bout us

There ain't nothin' common 'bout us

There ain't nothin' common 'bout us

I see all your flaws and imperfections

But that's what makes me love you more, oh-oh-oh

We got such a spiritual connection

Don't you know you're fuckin' beautiful

I will die if I don't try

Damned if I ask why

This is somethin' real

This is somethin' right

Never been in love

Never felt at all until now

As I lay in your bed

I need you on my chest

To warm me all the time

To tickle with your breath

Sweetin' on your lips

There ain't nothin' common 'bout us

In this ordinary world

Where nothin' is enough

Everything is grey

Mistake your love for lust

When I hold you in my arms

There ain't nothin' common 'bout us

There ain't nothin' common 'bout us

There ain't nothin' common 'bout us

I wanna feel your love

Just give me all your trust

Common ain't us

'Cause common ain't enough

In this ordinary world

Where nothin' is enough

Everything is grey

Mistake your love for lust

When I hold you in my arms

There ain't nothin' common 'bout us

There ain't nothin' common 'bout us

There ain't nothin' common 'bout us

There ain't nothin' common 'bout us

There ain't nothin' common 'bout us



### Imprint



We can leave an imprint

'Cause this minute that I'm in

'Cause this minute's where I live with you

Where I stay with you

If you wanna stay up late

Girl we'd still make it

If the planets all faded away

You might think I'm crazy

But I know you're my baby

Anyway

Girl you took two minutes out of my life

Yeah who told ya I am with it, I need ya

I don't want 'em back

I just want you back in my bed

I don't want 'em back

I just want you back in my bed

You can take it all off

'Cause this love ain't got no cost

No excuses I'll be cursed for you

It's just something that I say to you

If you want it I can change

Girl we'd still make it

If the planets all faded away

You might think I'm crazy

But I know you're my baby

Anyway

Girl you took two minutes out of my life

Yeah who told ya I am with it I, need ya

I don't want 'em back

I just want you back in my bed

I don't want 'em back

I just want you back in my bed

I never told you the story, oh

They say this building's from Victorian times

I guess we all got a story, oh

Just tellin' mine

Change the scenario

Jumpin' like Mario

Gotta give it all a go

Don't lose a life

Girl you took two minutes out of my life

Yeah who told ya I am with it, I need ya

I don't want 'em back

I just want you back in my bed

I don't want 'em back

I just want you back in my bed

Girl you took two minutes out of my life

Yeah who told ya I am with it, I need ya

I don't want 'em back

I just want you back in my bed

I don't want 'em back

I just want you back in my bed



### Stand Still



Skies are blue and birds of yellow

Flowers growing just to bloom

A million chances of our glances

Catching eyes across the room

If time stands still

Move I will to you

This was filmed

Somehow I see you

Move I will to you

Break up all upon your face now

Yet your beauty would still shine

I would live a thousand life times

If it's you I'm sent to find

If time stands still

Move I will to you

This was filmed

Somehow I see you

Move I will to you

Move all your body babe

Left to right, stop time getting stuck

Nothing can stop us

Move I don't want it babe

Left to rot, so tired of getting stuck

If time stands still

Move I will to you

This was filmed

Somehow I see you

If time stands still (If time stands still)

Move I will to you (Move I will to you)

This was filmed

Somehow I see you (Some how I see you)

Move I will to you



### Tonight



Just let me talk, you know what I'm sayin'

Don't give me that, girl I know you're stayin'

Where you goin', you feel that space, it's mine

Said we're goin', in every space and time

But love me tonight

Sweet girl of mine

Take all your time

I know that you're mine

So love me

Like we don't have tomorrow

Like there's no time at all, love

Love me like tomorrow's

Never gonna come

So love me

Like we don't have tomorrow

Like there's no time at all, love

Love me like tomorrow's

Never gonna come

Tell me why it's always different in the mornin'

Last night you were by my side

Space and time, I wanna fall into your eyes

There's no point in stallin' there's nothing to hide

Right now it's priceless, some things you can't buy

You're that protection that keeps me alive

Oh you got it right, you got it right

But love me tonight

Sweet girl of mine

Take all your time

I know that you're mine

So love me

Like we don't have tomorrow

Like there's no time at all, love

Love me like tomorrow's

Never gonna come

So love me

No matter where you are

Or where you'll be

When you're feelin' yourself

I know you're thinkin' of me

But love me tonight

Sweet girl of mine

Take all your time

I know that you're mine

So love me

Like we don't have tomorrow

Like there's no time at all, love

Love me like tomorrow's

Never gonna come

So love me

Like we don't have tomorrow

Like there's no time at all, love

Love me like tomorrow's

Never gonna come





### Flight Of The Stars

### If I Got You



Think I'm from space

Space soul fell down

I found the earth

Not leaving now

I know your face

Think you fell too

And ain't no place now, if I got you

Anywhere, anywhere

Anywhere you go

Anywhere you go

Round the Universe

I'll be there, I'll be there

Wherever you go, wherever you go, babe

Think I'm from space

My soul fell down

I found the earth

Not leaving now

I know your face

Think you fell too

And it's my place now, if I got you

If I got you, baby

You, baby

You

I don't care, I don't care

Wherever you been

Cause now you with me

Floating through the night

Feels like we're dancing

Is this the feeling

The feeling of falling in love

Cause I know that we met before, babe

Think I'm from space

My soul fell down

I found the earth

Not leaving now

I know your face

Think you fell too

And it's my place now, if I got you

If I got you, baby

You, baby

You, baby

You, baby

You

Think I'm from space

Space soul fell down

I found the earth

Not leaving now

I know your face

Think you fell too

And ain't no place now, if I got you

If I got you baby

You, baby

You, baby (if I got you)

You, baby

You





### Talk To Me



You look through

The hair on your face

The way that you say

The things that you do

I've been through

All of the games

All of the ways

That you've been fooled

I know I've seen your face

In different times and places

Come, get a little closer

I wanna get to know ya

We ain't keepin' no secrets

There'll be no sheets between us tonight

Talk to me, let's go deeper

You already know I need ya

We ain't keepin' no secrets

I wanna see ya leave on the lights

Talk to me, talk to me, yeah, oh

Talk to me, talk to me

Talk to me, talk to me

Talk to me, talk to me

Talk to me

Say your piece

The words that come out

Out of your mouth

I wanna hear

We can't be

Something divine

Planets align

Where we should be

I know I've seen your face

In different times and places

Come, get a little closer

I wanna get to know ya

We ain't keepin' no secrets

There'll be no sheets between us tonight

Talk to me, let's go deeper

You already know I need ya

We ain't keepin' no secrets

I wanna see ya leave on the lights

Talk to me, talk to me

Baby in my head

We can love forever

Here in my bed

Where we'll lay together

Come, get a little closer

I wanna get to know ya

We ain't keepin' no secrets

There'll be no sheets between us tonight

Talk to me, let's go deeper

You already know I need ya

We ain't keepin' no secrets

I wanna see ya leave on the lights

Talk to me, talk to me, yeah, oh

Talk to me, talk to me

Talk to me, talk to me

Talk to me, talk to me

Talk to me



### There You Are



Only you know me the way you know me

Only you forgive me when I'm sorry

Need you when I'm broken, when I'm fixed

Need you when I'm well, when I'm sick

Friends that I rely on don't come through

They run like the river, but not you

Can't see when I'm fallin', losing myself

But then I hear you calling

There you are, there you are

You're there with open arms

There you are, there you are

And I run

Whispers in the background, behind closed doors

I got myself in a mess and without you, I'm in more

Oh, I'm a little drunk now, that's why I went to war

Oh, yeah, you are my sober when I'm on the floor

Can't see when I'm fallin', losing myself

But then I hear you calling

There you are, there you are

You're there with open arms

There you are, there you are

And I run

Only you know me the way you know me

Only you forgive me when I'm sorry

Even when I messed it up

There you are

Need you when I'm hot

And when I'm cold

Need you when I'm young

When I'm old

You won't be far

There you are, there you are

You're there with open arms

There you are, there you are

And I run

Only you know me the way you know me

Only you forgive me when I'm sorry

Even when I messed it up

There you are

When you're caught in the crowds

When you're up in the clouds

When you're caught in the crowds

When you're up in the clouds

There you are





### I Don't Mind



I don't mind falling

If it means I get to fly again

Up in my island

Like a dream I'm trying to fight against

I don't mind mischief

We're just dancing in the dark again

The light blows

Don't wanna spend time on the issue

We'll never grow old when I'm with you

When I'm with

When I'm with

When I'm with

When I'm with you

The sun never comes up

When I'm with

When I'm with

When I'm with

When I'm with you

It's lit you can put it out

I can find you when you're lost

Girl you'll never see me running out

Anybody else is only

But you know I got your back I'm on your side

I don't mind

You can tell me your lies

I don't mind

You can me tell all night

When I'm with you

When you know I

Know you're playing with my mind

I don't mind

You can tell me your lies

I don't mind

You can me tell all night

When I'm with you

No I don't mind

I don't mind waiting

If you need some time to love again

I don't want nothing

Just a letter, something for the pain

I don't mind mischief

We're just dancing in the dark again

The light blows

Don't wanna spend time on the issue

We'll never grow old when I'm with you

When I'm with

When I'm with

When I'm with

When I'm with you

The sun never comes up

When I'm with

When I'm with

When I'm with

When I'm with you

It's lit you can put it out

I can find you when you're lost

Girl you'll never see me running out

Anybody else is only

But you know I got your back I'm on your side

I don't mind

You can tell me your lies

I don't mind

You can me tell all night

When I'm with you

When you know I

Know you're playing with my mind

I don't mind

You can tell me your lies

I don't mind

You can me tell me all night

When I'm with you

No I don't mind

I really don't mind if it's love

Been waiting for a sign in the night

I really don't mind if it's love

Girl you know

But you know I got your back I'm on your side

I don't mind

You can tell me your lies

I don't mind

You can me tell all night

When I'm with you

When you know I

You can me tell me all night

When I'm with you

No I don't mind



### Icarus Interlude



Ooh-ooh (Ooh, ooh, ooh)

Ooh-ooh (Ooh)

Ooh

Call me Icarus

I guess I flew too close to the sun

Myth'll call me legend, and I'ma be one

In my Yves Saint Laurent

Get the bees coming in for the honey I supply

And if you ain't got it now then you in for a surprise

You won't get it in a lifetime

I'm in the right place at the right time

Girl, you love me

Better than anyone

Girl, you love me

Better than love before

Girl, you love me

Better than I've known before

Better than I've known before

Ain't no stopping what I know (Before)

What I know, ain't no

Ain't no stopping what I feel

Plays on my mind in slo-mo

Every time as if it were real

Every night, oh, it's you I feel

That's how you're in my mind

I've been lying to the liars

I've been lying

I've been lying to the liars

I've been lying to the liars

I've been lying with the liars

Every night

Lying 'cause I'm flying

I've been lying to the liars

Lying to the liars



### Dusk Till Dawn



Not tryna be indie

Not tryna be cool

Just tryna be in this

Tell me, are you too?



Can you feel where the wind is?

Can you feel it through

All of the windows

Inside this room?



'Cause I wanna touch you, baby

And I wanna feel you too

I wanna see the Sun rise on your sins

Just me and you



Light it up, on the run

Let's make love tonight

Make it up, fall in love, try

(Baby, I'm right here)



But you'll never be alone

I'll be with you from dusk till dawn

I'll be with you from dusk till dawn

Baby, I'm right here

I'll hold you when things go wrong

I'll be with you from dusk till dawn

I'll be with you from dusk till dawn

Baby, I'm right here



I'll be with you from dusk till dawn

Baby, I'm right here



We were shut like a jacket

So do your zip

We would roll down the rapids

To find a wave that fits



Can you feel where the wind is?

Can you feel it through

All of the windows

Inside this room?



'Cause I wanna touch you, baby

I wanna feel you too

I wanna see the Sun rise on your sins

Just me and you



Light it up, on the run

Let's make love tonight

Make it up, fall in love, try

(Baby, I'm right here)



But you'll never be alone

I'll be with you from dusk till dawn

I'll be with you from dusk till dawn

Baby, I'm right here

I'll hold you when things go wrong

I'll be with you from dusk till dawn

I'll be with you from dusk till dawn

Baby, I'm right here



Girl, give love to your body

It's only you that can stop it

Girl, give love to your body

It's only you that can stop it



Girl, give love to your body

It's only you that can stop it

Girl, give love to your body

Girl, give love to your body



But you'll never be alone

I'll be with you from dusk till dawn

I'll be with you from dusk till dawn

Baby, I'm right here

I'll hold you when things go wrong

I'll be with you from dusk till dawn

I'll be with you from dusk till dawn

Baby, I'm right here



I'll be with you from dusk till dawn

Baby, I'm right here

### Good Guy



Don't you fall for me, girl

I'm not the right kind

I'm a bad man

I will do all I can to keep you by my side

Just 'cause I know it feels right

Explain every story, not boring

Girl, I'll be the only thing up when you're dropping

From purpose

Present and future

Hi, Mr. President, a pleasure to meet you

Hope you feel my presence 'cause it's making a feature

Working on instinct like an extinct creature

Hands all lockin' me in, slide bleacher

Street lamps lit like they're trying to teach us

I've seen this scene before, real life

The nature wrote the score, my lines (my lines)

Look into your eyes, and

I'm not a good guy

I'm not a good guy

But I know you're mine (bang)

I know you're mine (bang bang)

I'm not a good guy

I'm not a good guy

But I know you're mine (bang)

But I know you're mine (bang bang)





### You Wish You Knew



Girl I got a problem

Unless we trust

You could be the best friend

Or you could be the one

But girl I got a problem

Unless we trust in love

Don't wanna put my love there, you

Don't wanna make a headline and lose

Don't wanna be the one that you choose

'Cause I'm the one, the one, the one that

You wish you knew

You wish you knew

You wish you knew

You wish you knew

You wish you knew

Don't wanna be the one that you choose

'Cause I'm the one, the one, the one that

You wish you knew

Now you say the one thing

When you mean that

Holding onto nothing

Why you holding back

'Cause girl I got a problem

Unless we trust

Girl I got a problem

Trust in love

Don't wanna put my love there, you

Don't wanna make a headline and lose

Don't wanna be the one that you choose

'Cause I'm the one, the one, the one that

You wish you knew

You wish you knew

You wish you knew

You wish you knew

You wish you knew

Don't wanna be the one that you choose

'Cause I'm the one, the one, the one that

You wish you knew

Do you hear yourself

Do you speak

Do you see yourself desperately

Talking trying to act like you mad

I don't know you like that

I don't know you like that

Don't wanna put my love there, you

Don't wanna make a headline and lose

Don't wanna be the one that you choose

'Cause I'm the one, the one, the one that

You wish you knew

You wish you knew

You wish you knew

You wish you knew

You wish you knew

Don't wanna be the one that you choose

'Cause I'm the one, the one, the one that

You wish you knew



### Sour Diesel



Walks in the place, hands on her waist

Gun on her thigh, big shooter game

She did this before, murdered to gain

Promised her ma she won't kill again



She got it and she know she got it

I'm takin' off like a rocket

Spaceship, so high I can't stop it



Like sour diesel

I can't stop the feelin'

Can't stop your feet, no

Feels like I'm dreaming

Didn't feel it seep in

She burn, she burn, she burn



Like a sour diesel (she burn, she burn, she burn)

Like a sour diesel (she burn, she burn, she burn)

I can't stop the feelin' (she burn, she burn, she burn)

Can't stop your feet, no

Like a sour diesel (she burn, she burn, she burn)

She burn, she burn, she burn

Like sour diesel



The look's on her face, back in my place

Legs in the air, all dirty again

Smokin' some more, I'm in her space

She touches me there, then I do it again



She got it and she know she got it

I'm takin' off like a rocket

Spaceship, so high I can't stop it



Like a sour diesel (she burn, she burn, she burn)

Like asour diesel (she burn, she burn, she burn)

I can't stop the feelin', no (she burn, she burn, she burn)

Can't stop your feet, no

Like a sour diesel (she burn, she burn, she burn)

She burn, she burn, she burn

Like sour diesel (she burn, she burn, she burn)

Feels like the heat, yeah

When the flame is here (she burn, she burn, she burn)

I can't stop the feeling

Can't stop the feet (she burn, she burn, she burn)

Like a sour diesel

Can't stop the feelin', oh (she burn, she burn, she burn)

No, I can't stop



'Cause it's burnin' all around you

I'm so glad I found you

'Cause it's burnin' all around you

I'm so glad I found you

Woo, yeah, yeah



Yeah! Like sour diesel (she burn, she burn, she burn)

Like sour diesel (she burn, she burn, she burn)

Like sour diesel (she burn, she burn, she burn)

Like a sour diesel, like a sour diesel (she burn, she burn, she burn)

Ooh, yeah (she burn, she burn, she burn)

I can't stop the feelin' (she burn, she burn, she burn)

Yeah, sour diesel, wow (she burn, she burn, she burn)

Like sour diesel (she burn, she burn, she burn)

She burn



### Satisfaction



Nobody said this would be easy

Nobody said this would be hard

Nobody gave me a rulebook to follow

And my soul's not hollow

You see, we gotta find our place

And we'll go there now

I can't get no satisfaction alone



'Cause I can't, you can't, we can't get no

Satisfaction



All in my zone, all in my space

Life is always in the way

All in my zone, all in my space

Life is always in the way



Nobody said that you would leave me

Nobody says that in this dark

Somebody told me about tomorrow

And my soul's not hollow

You see, we gotta find our place

And we'll go there now

We can't get no satisfaction alone



'Cause I can't, you can't, we can't get no

Satisfaction



All in my zone, all in my space

Life is always in the way

All in my zone, all in my space

Life is always in the way



As you try your best to pull away

Something surges, urges you to stay

'Cause I can't, you can't, we can't get no

Satisfaction



I can't, you can't, we can't get no



All in my zone, all in my space

Life is always in the way

All in my zone, all in my space

Life is always in the way



We gotta find our place

And we'll go there now

I can't get no satisfaction alone

I can't get no satisfaction all alone



### Scripted



Blurry TV screens

Fuzzy broken scenes

Finding words, don't have flow

Blurry TV screens

Fuzzy broken scenes

Hold her close, finding love



Hearts don't feel the same

And the names we like to say

Change with time and age



So I

I don't wanna say what's scripted

Whether you are or aren't with it

I know what I need

'Cause I

I don't wanna say what's scripted

Whether you are or aren't with it

I know what I need



Hearts don't feel the same

And the names we like to say

Change with time and age



So I

I don't wanna say what's scripted

Whether you are or aren't with it

I know what I need

'Cause I

I don't wanna say what's scripted

Whether you are or aren't with it

I know what I need



You still remember my eyes

Even if the Men In Black flashed their light into your eyes

For the second time this night

It feels right, then it's only you and I

Oh, you and I

Oh, you and I

Oh, you and I

Oh, you and I



So I

I don't wanna says what's scripted

Whether you are or aren't with it

I know what I need

'Cause I

I don't wanna say what's scripted

Whether you are or aren't with it

I know what I need



### Entertainer



[Verse 1]

You thought you had me, didn't you?

When you lied to my face, I could see the truth

Every step of the way I knew

How you fooled me, boo



[Pre-Chorus]

Guess you didnât know that

You were my favorite entertainer

I'd watch you, I'd laugh, I would fuck with you

Donât you take me for a fool

In this game, I own the rules

You were my favorite entertainer

I'd watch you, I'd laugh, I would fake it too

Don't you take me for a fool

I'ma show you a thing or two



[Chorus]

Never see me coming, I'll turn you down

When you need me the most, I will turn you

When you need me the most, I will turn you down

Never see me coming, I'll turn you down

When you need me the most, I will turn you

When you need me the most, I will turn you down



[Verse 2]

Thought that you were smarter, I'm ashamed for you

I knew it right away when you stopped lovinâ me

It happened when your touch wasnât enough for me

When you need me the most, I will turn you down



[Bridge]

Know it's harder to take, and let's face it

No one's playing your games, but let's face it

I'm being straight up

I know fake love when I see it anyway

I'ma turn you down when you need me anyway, anyway, anyway

[Chorus]

Never see me coming, I'll turn you down

When you need me the most, I will turn you

When you need me the most, I will turn you down

Never see me coming, I'll turn you down

When you need me the most, I will turn you

When you need me the most, I will turn you down



[Outro]

I know you need me the most

The most, the most (One more time)



### All That



When I woke up this morning

The sun had just dawned in

My bed, or your bed

Was the first or the last time

I don't care, it feels right

I'm not, not stopping all night

Things fall apart and in a part you feel distant

Reaction are instant if emotions are constant

Let's say for instance that you had a conscience

Would you take the time then to weigh out the options

All that, all that

You can give me all that

All that, all that

All that, all that

You can give me all that

All that, all that

Stay here in the morning

You can take it all back

All back, all back

Baby, if you want to you can give me

All that, all that, all that

Never cross my mind

Have I crossed the lines

Or is there more to find, more to find

I think inside, immortalized

Mortalized, mortal life

Coming from both sides

An attack of the mind

Like Optimus prime in his prime

Kick it, don't skip it, to the finish line

This minute's mine

All that, all that

You can give me all that

All that, all that (you can give me all that)

All that, all that

You can give me all that

All that, all that

Stay here in the morning

You can take it all back

All back, all back

Baby, if you want to you can give me

All that, all that, all that

All that, all that

You can give me all that

All that, all that (you can give me all that)

All that, all that

You can give me all that

All that, all that

Stay here in the morning

You can take it all back

All back, all back

Baby, if you want to you can give me

All that, all that, all that





### Good Years



I'd rather be anywhere, anywhere but here

I'd rather be anywhere, anywhere but here

I close my eyes and see a crowd of a thousand tears

I pray to God I didn't waste all my good years

All my good years

All my good years

The voices screaming loud as hell

We don't care 'bout no one else

Nothing in the world could bring us down

Now we're so high among the stars without a worry

And neither one, one of us wants to say we're sorry

I'd rather be anywhere, anywhere but here

I'd rather be anywhere, anywhere but here

I close my eyes and see a crowd of a thousand tears

I pray to God I didn't waste all my good years

All my good years

All my good years

Too much drugs and alcohol

What the hell were we fighting for?

'Cause now the whole damn world will know

That we're too numb and just too dumb to change the story

Neither one, one of us wants to say we're sorry

I'd rather be anywhere, anywhere but here

I'd rather be anywhere, anywhere but here

I close my eyes and see a crowd of a thousand tears

I pray to God I didn't waste all my good years

All my good years

All my good years

Need a chance just to breathe, feel alive

And when the day meets the night, show me the light

Feel the wind and the fire

Hold the pain deep inside

It's in my eyes

In my eyes

I'd rather be anywhere, anywhere but here

I'd rather be anywhere, anywhere but here

I close my eyes and see a crowd of a thousand tears

I pray to God I didn't waste all my good years

All my good years

All my good years

I pray to God I didn't waste all my good years

All my good years

All my good years



### Fresh Air



You could be a changed man if you wanted

You could make the doves cry if you wanted

Tell me that you wanna die but you don't

Tell me that you wanna die but you don't

I say I'm sorry, but you're never sober

I start drinkin', it's too much thinkin', oh

It's the same every time that you're with me

I think I need some fresh air

Feelin' under pressure

Don't wanna talk about it

Don't even get me started

Over you

You know I ain't tryna go pressure you

You and me got differences, differences

You and me got differences

Why you want some different shit?

You and me got differences, differences

You and me got differences

Why you want some different shit?

Caught in the cyclone

It's a part of my cycle

Could've been right though

Guess that's how life go

Ain't nothin' more I can do for you

I think I need some fresh air

Feelin' under pressure

Don't wanna talk about it

Don't even get me started

Over you

You know I ain't tryna go pressure you

I think I need some fresh air

Feelin' under pressure

Don't wanna talk about it

Don't even get me started

Over you

You know I ain't tryna go pressure you

You and me got differences, differences

You and me got differences

Why you want some different shit?

You and me got differences, differences

You and me got differences

Why you want some different shit?

Why you want some different shit?

You could be a changed man if you wanted

You could make the doves cry if you wanted

Tell me that you wanna die but you don't

Tell me that you wanna die but you don't





### Rainberry



Rainberry, please

You think I'm on my knees

But don't you worry

I know what you don't know, oh oh

Don't even start

The truth won't break my heart

No, don't you worry

I already know, oh oh



Too many bones inside your closet

You thought you buried deep

But they never let me get a minute of peace

How do you sleep? Ooh



Rainberry

Falling down your blood red lips

Why are you eyes heavy?

Is there somebody else you miss?

Tell me what's going on

Before I go too far

Said Rainberry, is there somebody else

Somebody else now?



Dry your eyes

'Cause it won't work this time

I already dried mine

And I'm not drying yours

Go wash your hands

But you can't change the past

Those stories ain't shit now

You don't mean it, I'm sure



Too many bones inside your closet

You thought you buried deep

But they never let me get a minute of peace

How do you sleep?



Rainberry

Falling down your blood red lips

Why are you eyes heavy?

Is there somebody else you miss?

Tell me what's going on

Before I go too far

Said Rainberry, is there somebody else

Somebody else now?



Rainberry (berry, berry, berry, berry, berry)

Rainberry (berry, berry, berry, berry, berry)

Rainberry

Rainberry, please

Rainberry

Rainberry, please

Rainberry, please



Too many bones inside your closet

You thought you buried deep

But they never let me get a minute of peace

How do you sleep? Ooh



Rainberry

Falling down your blood red lips

Why are you eyes heavy?

Is there somebody else you miss?

Tell me what's going on

Before I go too far

Said Rainberry, is there somebody else

Somebody else now?



### Insomnia



Insomnia Lyrics

[Verse 1]

I've been roaming and strolling

All in the streets

Burning my eyes red

Not slept for weeks

Testing your torment

My future is bleak

Lost in the moment

With no words to speak



[Pre-Chorus]

I can't find no peace

(I can't find no peace)



[Chorus]

Am I a fool

Waiting for you?

What if you never come back?

What if you never come back?

There's nothing new

I made another hit, I made another tune

What if we never know why hearts deceive us?

The night calls to dreamers



[Verse 2]

My sleep was stolen

I'm searching for thieves

These memories in my head

So vivid to see

Waiting for you?

What if you never come back?

What if you never come back?

There's nothing new

I made another hit, I made another tune

What if we never know why hearts deceive us?

The night calls to dreamers

Insomnia

And when I close my eyes I feel it all again

Insomnia

And when I close my eyes I feel it all again



[Chorus]

Am I a fool

Waiting for you?

What if you never come back?

There's nothing new

I made another hit, I made another tune

What if we never know why hearts deceive us?

The night calls to dreamers

### Fingers



Fucked and I want ya

Looked and I loved ya

Stuck, now I need ya

Hopin' I'd see ya

Touch and I feel how

Much can you see her, no

Hiding all your features, sliding down the filter

Show me, you just in the middle

Don't be hiding what you thinkin'

I've been fucked and I want ya, I can't even text ya

'Cause my fingers ain't working, but my heart is

If you wanna let me know where you hiding

I could come and love (I could come and love)

I could come and love (I could come and love ya)

I could come and love ya (I could come and love)

I could come and love ya (I could come and love ya)

What did I tell ya? Typo said I loved ya

Didn't mean what I was saying

No, I wasn't playing, just confused

Was tryna play it smooth

Start spinnin' in this room

In this state, I think I'm too

This state, I think I'm too

'Cause I'm fucked and I want ya, I can't even text ya

'Cause my fingers ain't working, but my heart is

If you wanna let me know where you hiding

I could come and love (I could come and love)

I could come and love (I could come and love ya)

I could come and love ya (I could come and love)

I could come and love ya (I could come and love ya)

I know it's takin' all your strength to keep it straight

'Cause you got different things replacin'

All the feelings that you've felt

Know you're seeing it for yourself

Where's the shame? No shame in what you need

Fucked and I want ya, I can't even text ya

'Cause my fingers ain't working, but my heart is

If you wanna let me know where you hiding

I could come and love (I could come and love)

I could come and love (I could come and love ya)

Won't leave my mind, kinda sidetracked

Must be an affliction (yeah, yeah)

## Under My skin



### Take Me Away



I cannot find a way to describe it

It's there inside, all I do is hide

I wish that it would just go away

What would you do, you do, if you knew?

What would you do?

All the pain I thought I knew

All the thoughts lead back to you

Back to what was never said

Back and forth inside my head

I can't handle this confusion

I'm unable, come and take me away

I feel like I am all alone

All by myself, I need to get around this

My words are cold, I don't want them to hurt you

If I show you, I don't think you'd understand

'Cause no one understands

All the pain I thought I knew

All the thoughts lead back to you

Back to what was never said

Back and forth inside my head

I can't handle this confusion

I'm unable, come and take me away

I'm going nowhere (On and on and)

I'm getting nowhere (On and on and on), take me away

I'm going nowhere (On and off and off and on and off and on)

All the pain I thought I knew

All the thoughts lead back to you

Back to what was never said

Back and forth inside my head

I can't handle this confusion

I'm unable, come and take me away

Take me away

Break me away

Take me away





### Together



Something just isn't right

I can feel it inside

The truth isn't far behind me

You can't deny

When I turn the lights out

When I close my eyes

Reality overcomes me

I'm living a lie

When I'm alone

I feel so much better

And when I'm around you

I don't feel

Together

It doesn't feel right at all

Together

Together, we built a wall

Together

Holding hands will fall

Hands will fall

This has gone on so long

I realize that I need

Something good to rely on

Something for me

When I'm alone

I feel so much better

And when I'm around you

I don't feel

Together

It doesn't feel right at all

Together

Together, we built a wall

Together

Holding hands will fall

Hands will fall

My heart is broken

I'm lying here

My thoughts are choking on you, my dear

On you, my dear

On you, my dear

When I'm alone

I feel so much better

And when I'm around you

I don't feel

Together

It doesn't feel right at all

Together

Together, we built a wall

Together

Holding hands will fall

Hands will fall

Together

It doesn't feel right at all

Together

Together we built a wall

Together

Holding hands will fall

Hands will fall

When I'm around you

When I'm around you

I don't feel together

I don't feel together

When I'm around you (together)

When I'm around you (together)

I don't feel together (together)

I don't feel together (together)



### Don't Tell Me



You held my hand and walked me home, I know

While you gave me that kiss you were something like this

It made me go, oh, oh

You wiped my tears got rid of all my fears

Why did you have to go?

Guess it wasn't enough to take up some of my love

Guys are so hard to trust

Did I not tell you that I'm not like that

Girl, the one who gives it all away, yeah?

Did you think that I was gonna give it up to you this time?

Did you think that it was somethin' I was gonna do and cry?

Don't try to tell me what to do

Don't try to tell me what to say

You're better off that way

Don't think that your charm

And the fact that your arm is now around my neck

Will get you in my pants, I'll have to kick your ass

And make you never forget

I'm gonna ask you to stop thought I liked you a lot

But I'm really upset (really upset)

Get outta my head, get off of my bed

Yeah, that's what I said

Did I not tell you that I'm not like that

Girl, the one who throws it all away?

Did you think that I was gonna give it up to you this time?

Did you think that it was somethin' I was gonna do and cry?

Don't try to tell me what to do

Don't try to tell me what to say

You're better off that way

This guilt trip that you put me on won't mess me up

I've done no wrong

Any thoughts of you and me have gone away

Did you think that I was gonna give it up to you this time?

Did you think that it was somethin' I was gonna do and cry?

Don't try to tell me what to do

Don't try to tell me what to say

You're better off that way, yeah (better off that way)

I'm better off alone anyway



### He Wasn't



There's not much going on today

I'm really bored, it's getting late

What happened to my Saturday? (Saturday)

Monday's coming, the day I hate, hate

I'll sit on the bed alone (bed alone)

Staring at the phone

He wasn't what I wanted, what I thought, no

He wouldn't even open up the door

He never made me feel like I was special

He isn't really what I'm looking for

This is where I start to bite my nails

And clean my room when all else fails

I think it's time for me to bail (time to bail)

This point of view is getting stale

I'll sit on the bed alone (bed alone)

Staring at the phone (at the phone)

He wasn't what I wanted, what I thought, no

He wouldn't even open up the door

He never made me feel like I was special

He isn't really what I'm looking for

Uh-uh (hey, hey)

Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh-uh (hey, hey)

Uh-uh (hey, hey)

Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh-uh (hey, hey)

Na, na, na-na-na

We've all got choices

Na, na, na-na

We've all got voices

Na, na, na-na-na

Stand up, make some noise

Na, na, na-na

Stand up, make some noise

I'll sit on the bed alone

Staring at the phone

He wasn't what I wanted, what I thought, no

He wouldn't even open up the door

He never made me feel like I was special

He isn't really what I'm looking for

He wasn't what I wanted, what I thought, no

He wouldn't even open up the door

He never made me feel like I was special

Like I was special, 'cause I was special

Uh-uh

Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh-uh

Uh-uh

Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh-uh

Na, na, na-na-na





### How Does It Feel



I'm not afraid of anything

I just need to know that I can breathe

And I don't need much of anything

But suddenly, suddenly

I am small and the world is big

All around me is fast moving

Surrounded by so many things

Suddenly, suddenly

How does it feel to be

Different from me

Are we the same

How does it feel to be

Different from me

Are we the same

How does it feel?

I'm young and I am free

But I get tired and I get weak

I get lost and I can't sleep

But suddenly, suddenly

How does it feel to be

Different from me

Are we the same

How does it feel to be

Different from me

Are we the same

How does it feel?

Would you comfort me

Would you cry with me

Uh-uh-oh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh

Uh-uh-oh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh

I am small and the world is big

But I'm not afraid of anything

How does it feel to be

Different from me

Are we the same

How does it feel to be

Different from me

Are we the same

How does it feel to be

Different from me

Are we the same

How does it feel to be

Different from me

Are we the same

Ah, ah, ah, ahh-ah, ahh-ah

Ah, ah, ah, ahh-ah, ahh-ah

How does it feel, how does it feel

Different from me, different

How does it feel, how does it feel

Different from me, different

How does it feel, how does it feel

Different from me, different

How does it feel, how does it feel

Different from me





### My Happy Ending



Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

So much for my happy ending

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

So much for my happy ending

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Let's talk this over

It's not like we're dead

Was it something I did?

Was it something you said?

Don't leave me hanging

In a city so dead

Held up so high on such a breakable thread (breakable thread)

You were all the things I thought I knew

And I thought we could be

You were everything, everything that I wanted (that I wanted)

We were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it (we lost it)

And all of the memories, so close to me, just fade away

All this time you were pretending

So much for my happy ending

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

So much for my happy ending

Oh, oh, oh, oh

You've got your dumb friends

I know what they say (know what they say)

They tell you I'm difficult

But so are they (but so are they)

But they don't know me

Do they even know you? (even know you)

All the things you hide from me

All the shit that you do (all the shit that you do)

You were all the things I thought I knew

And I thought we could be

You were everything, everything that I wanted (that I wanted)

We were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it (we lost it)

And all of the memories, so close to me, just fade away

All this time you were pretending

So much for my happy ending

It's nice to know that you were there

Thanks for acting like you cared

And making me feel like I was the only one

It's nice to know we had it all

Thanks for watching as I fall

And letting me know we were done

He was everything, everything that I wanted

We were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it

And all of the memories, so close to me just fade away

All this time you were pretending

So much for my happy ending

You were everything, everything that I wanted (that I wanted)

We were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it

And all of the memories, so close to me, just fade away

All this time you were pretending

So much for my happy ending

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

So much for my happy ending

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

So much for my happy ending

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh



### Nobodyâs Home



Well, I couldn't tell you

Why she felt that way

She felt it everyday

I couldn't help her

I just watched her make

The same mistakes again

What's wrong, what's wrong now?

Too many, too many problems

Don't know where she belongs

Where she belongs

She wants to go home, but nobody's home

That's where she lies, broken inside

With no place to go, no place to go

To dry her eyes, broken inside

Open your eyes

And look outside

Find the reasons why

You've been rejected

And now you can't find

What you've left behind

Be strong, be strong now

Too many, too many problems

Don't know where she belongs

Where she belongs

She wants to go home, but nobody's home

That's where she lies, broken inside

With no place to go, no place to go

To dry her eyes, broken inside

Her feelings, she hides

Her dreams, she can't find

She's losing her mind

She's falling behind

She can't find her place

She's losing her faith

She's falling from grace

She's all over the place, yeah

She wants to go home, but nobody's home

That's where she lies, broken inside

With no place to go, no place to go

To dry her eyes, broken inside

She's lost inside, lost inside

Oh, oh

She's lost inside, lost inside

Oh, oh





### Forgotten



Ah, ah, oh, oh

Ah, ah, oh, oh

Ah, ah, oh, oh

Ah, ah, oh, oh

I'm giving up on everything

Because you messed me up

Don't know how much you screwed it up

You never listen

That's just too bad

Because I'm moving on

I won't forget

You were the one that was wrong

I know I need to step up and be strong

Don't patronize me

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Have you forgotten everything that I wanted?

Do you forget it now you never got it?

Do you get it now?

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Ah, ah, oh, oh

Ah, ah, oh, oh

Gotta get away

There's no point in thinking about yesterday

It's too late now

It will never be the same

We're so different now

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Have you forgotten everything that I wanted?

Do you forget it now you never got it?

Do you get it now?

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I know I wanna run away

I know I wanna run away, run away

If only I could run away

If only I could run away, run away

I told you what I wanted

I told you what I wanted, what I wanted

But I was forgotten

I won't be forgotten, never again!

Have you forgotten everything that I wanted?

Do you forget it now you never got it?

Do you get it now?

Forgotten, yeah, yeah, yeah

Forgotten, yeah, yeah, yeah

Forgotten, yeah, yeah, yeah

Forgotten, yeah, yeah, yeah



### Who Knows



Yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah

Why do you look so familiar?

I could swear that I

Have seen your face before

I think I like that you seem sincere

I think I'd like to get

To know you a little bit more

I think there's something more

Life's worth living for

Who knows what could happen?

Do what you do

Just keep on laughing

One thing's true

There's always a brand new day

I'm gonna live today like it's my last day

Yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah

How do you always have an opinion?

And how do you always find

The best way to compromise?

We don't need to have a reason

We don't need anything

We're just wasting time

I think there's something more

Life's worth living for

Who knows what could happen?

Do what you do

Just keep on laughing

One thing's true

There's always a brand new day

Who knows what could happen?

Do what you do

Just keep on laughing

One thing's true

There's always a brand new day

I'm gonna live today like it's my last day

Find yourself

'Cause I can't find you

Be yourself

Who are you?

Find yourself

'Cause I can't find you

Be yourself

Who are you?

Who knows what could happen?

Do what you do

Just keep on laughing

One thing's true

There's always a brand new day

So you go make it happen

Do your best

Just keep on laughing

I'm telling you

There's always a brand new day

Who knows what could happen?

Do what you do

Just keep on laughing

One thing's true

There's always a brand new day

I'm gonna live today like it's my last day



### Fall to Pieces



I looked away

Then I looked back at you

You tried to say

Things that you can't undo

If I had my way

I'd never get over you

Today's the day

I pray that we make it through

Make it through the fall

Make it through it all

And I don't want to fall to pieces

I just want to sit and stare at you

I don't want to talk about it

And I don't want a conversation

I just want to cry in front of you

I don't want to talk about it

'Cause I'm in love with you

You're the only one

I'd be with 'til the end

When I come undone

You bring me back again

Back under the stars

Back into your arms

And I don't want to fall to pieces

I just want to sit and stare at you

I don't want to talk about it

And I don't want a conversation

I just want to cry in front of you

I don't want to talk about it

'Cause I'm in love with you

Want to know who you are

Want to know where to start

I want to know what this means

Want to know how you feel

Want to know what is real

I want to know everything, everything

And I don't want to fall to pieces

I just want to sit and stare at you

I don't want to talk about it

And I don't want a conversation

I just want to cry in front of you

I don't want to talk about it

And I don't want to fall to pieces

I just want to sit and stare at you

I don't want to talk about it

And I don't want a conversation

I just want to cry in front of you

I don't want to talk about it

'Cause I'm in love with you

I'm in love with you

'Cause I'm in love with you

I'm in love with you

I'm in love with you



### Freak Out



Try to tell me what I shouldn't do

You should know by now, I won't listen to you

Walk around with my hands up in the air

'Cause I don't care

'Cause I'm alright, I'm fine

Just freak out, let it go

I'm gonna live my life

I can't ever run and hide

I won't compromise 'cause I'll never know

I'm gonna close my eyes

I can't watch the time go by

I won't keep it inside

Freak out, let it go

Just freak out, let it go

You don't always have to do everything right

Stand up for yourself

And put up a fight

Walk around with your hands up in the air

Like you don't care

'Cause I'm alright, I'm fine

Just freak out, let it go

I'm gonna live my life

I can't ever run and hide

I won't compromise 'cause I'll never know

I'm gonna close my eyes

I can't watch the time go by

I won't keep it inside

Freak out, let it go

Let it go

Yeah, yeah, yeah

Just let me live my life

I can't ever run and hide

I won't compromise 'cause I'll never know

I'm gonna close my eyes

I can't watch the time go by

I won't keep it inside

Freak out, let it go

Gonna freak out, let it go

Gonna freak out, let it go



### Slipped Away



Na, na, na, na, na, na, na

I miss you, miss you so bad

I don't forget you, oh, it's so sad

I hope you can hear me

I remember it clearly

The day you slipped away

Was the day I found it won't be the same, oh

Na, na, na, na, na, na, na

I didn't get around to kiss you

Goodbye on the hand

I wish that I could see you again

I know that I can't

Oh, I hope you can hear me, 'cause I remember it clearly

The day you slipped away

Was the day I found it won't be the same, oh

I've had my wake up

Won't you wake up

I keep asking why (I keep asking why)

And I can't take it

It wasn't fake

It happened, you passed by

Now you're gone, now you're gone

There you go, there you go

Somewhere I can't bring you back

Now you're gone, now you're gone

There you go, there you go

Somewhere, you're not coming back

The day you slipped away

Was the day I found it won't be the same, no

The day you slipped away

Was the day that I found it won't be the same, oh

Na, na, na, na, na, na, na

I miss you

## AM



### Do I Wanna Know?



Have you got colour in your cheeks?

Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift

The type that sticks around like summat in your teeth?

Are there some aces up your sleeve?

Have you no idea that you're in deep?

I dreamt about you nearly every night this week



How many secrets can you keep?

'Cause there's this tune I found

That makes me think of you somehow

And I play it on repeat

Until I fall asleep

Spilling drinks on my settee



(Do I wanna know)

If this feeling flows both ways?

(Sad to see you go)

Was sorta hoping that you'd stay

(Baby, we both know)

That the nights were mainly made

For saying things that you can't say tomorrow day



Crawling back to you

Ever thought of calling when you've had a few?

'Cause I always do

Maybe I'm too busy being yours to fall for somebody new

Now, I've thought it through

Crawling back to you



So, have you got the guts?

Been wondering if your heart's still open

And if so, I wanna know what time it shuts

Simmer down and pucker up

I'm sorry to interrupt, it's just I'm constantly on the cusp

Of trying to kiss you

I don't know if you feel the same as I do

But we could be together if you wanted to



(Do I wanna know)

If this feeling flows both ways?

(Sad to see you go)

Was sorta hoping that you'd stay

(Baby, we both know)

That the nights were mainly made

For saying things that you can't say tomorrow day



Crawling back to you (crawling back to you)

Ever thought of calling when you've had a few? (You've had a few?)

'Cause I always do ('cause I always do)

Maybe I'm too (maybe I'm too busy)

Busy being yours (being yours)

To fall for somebody new

Now, I've thought it through

Crawling back to you



(Do I wanna know)

If this feeling flows both ways?

(Sad to see you go)

Was sorta hoping that you'd stay

(Baby, we both know)

That the nights were mainly made

For saying things that you can't say tomorrow day



(Do I wanna know?)

Too busy being yours to fall

(Sad to see you go)

Ever thought of calling, darling?

(Do I wanna know?)

Do you want me crawling back to you?







### R U Mine?



I'm a puppet on a string

Tracy Island, time-traveling

Diamond cutter-shaped heartaches

Come to find you four in some velvet morning

Years too late, she's a silver lining

Lone ranger riding through an open space

In my mind when she's not right there beside me

I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be

And satisfaction feels like a distant memory

And I can't help myself, all I

Wanna hear her say is "Are you mine?"

Well, are you mine?

Are you mine?

Are you mine? Oh, ah

I guess what I'm tryna say is I need the deep end

Keep imagining meeting, wished away entire lifetimes

Unfair we're not somewhere misbehaving for days

Great escape, lost track of time and space

She's a silver lining climbing on my desire

And I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be

And satisfaction feels like a distant memory

And I can't help myself, all I

Wanna hear her say is "Are you mine?"

Well, are you mine? (Are you mine tomorrow?)

Are you mine? (Or just mine tonight?)

Are you mine? (Are you mine, mine?)

And the thrill of the chase moves in mysterious ways

So in case, I'm mistaken, I

Just wanna hear you say, "You got me, baby

Are you mine?"

She's a silver lining

Lone ranger riding through an open space

In my mind when she's not right there beside me

I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be

And satisfaction feels like a distant memory

And I can't help myself, all I

Wanna hear her say is "Are you mine?"

Well, are you mine? (Are you mine tomorrow?)

Are you mine? (Or just mine tonight?)

Are you mine? (Are you mine tomorrow?)

(Or just mine tonight?)



### One for the Road



One for the road, ooh-ooh

One for the road, ooh-ooh

From the bottom of your heart, the relegation zone

I saw this coming from the start

The shake, rattle and roll

All the cracks in blackout blinds cast patterns on the ceiling

But you're feeling fine

I thought it was dark outside

I thought it was dark outside

So we all get back to yours and you sit and talk to me on the floor

There's no need to show me 'round, baby

I feel like I've been here before

I've been wonderin' whether later, when you tell everybody to go

Will you pour me one for the road?

I knew this would be on the cards

I knew you wouldn't fold

I saw this comin' from the start

The shake, rattle and roll

So we all get back to yours and you sit and talk to me on the floor

There's no need to show me 'round, baby

I feel like I've been here before

I've been wonderin' whether later, when you tell everybody to go

Will you pour me one for the road?

The mixture hits you hard

Don't get that sinking feeling, don't fall apart

Some out of tune guitar

Soundtrack to disaster

Ooh-ooh, one for the road

Ooh-ooh, one for the road

Ooh-ooh, one for the road

Ooh-ooh, one for the road

Ooh-ooh

Ooh-ooh

Ooh-ooh

Ooh-ooh

So we all get back to yours and you sit and talk to me on the floor

There's no need to show me 'round, baby

I feel like I've been here before

I've been wonderin' whether later, when you tell everybody to go

Will you pour me one for the road?





### Arabella



Arabella's got some interstellar gator-skin boots

And a Helter Skelter 'round her little finger and I ride it endlessly

She's got a Barbarella silver swimsuit

And when she needs to shelter from reality she takes a dip in my daydreams

My days end best when the sunset gets itself

Behind that little lady sittin' on the passenger side

It's much less picturesque without her catchin' the light

The horizon tries but it's just not as kind on the eyes

As Arabella, oh

As Arabella

Just might've tapped into your mind and soul

You can't be sure

Arabella's got a seventies head

But she's a modern lover, it's an exploration, she's made of outer space

And her lips are like the galaxy's edge

And her kiss the color of a constellation fallin' into place

My days end best when the sunset gets itself

Behind that little lady sittin' on the passenger side

It's much less picturesque without her catchin' the light

The horizon tries but it's just not as kind on the eyes

As Arabella, oh

As Arabella

Just might've tapped into your mind and soul

You can't be sure

That's magic in a cheetah-print coat

Just a slip underneath it I hope

Askin' if I can have one of those

Organic cigarettes that she smokes

Wraps her lips 'round a Mexican Coke

Makes you wish that you were the bottle

Takes a sip of your soul and it sounds like

Just might've tapped into your mind and soul

You can't be sure



### I Want It All



Blind faith, heartache

Mind games, mistakes

My sweet fireball

My sweet rigmarole

I want it all

I want it all

Old dogs, new tricks

Can you feel it?

Space age country girl

Stone cold miracle

I want it all

I want it all

And then suddenly it hit me

It's a year ago

Since I drank miniature whiskey

And we shared your Coke

Said, ain't it just like you to kiss me

And then hit the road?

Leave me listening to the Stones

Two-thousand light years from home

Shoo-wop, shoo-wop, shoo-wop, shoo-wop, shoo-wop, shoo-wop

Shoo-wop, shoo-wop, shoo-wop, shoo-wop, shoo-wop, shoo-wop

Shoo-wop, shoo-wop, shoo-wop, shoo-wop, shoo-wop, shoo-wop

I want it all

I want it all

I want it all

I want it all



### No. 1 Party Anthem



So you're on the prowl wondering whether

She left already or not

Leather jacket, collar popped like Cantonna

Never knowing when to stop

Sunglasses indoors, par for the course

Lights in the floors and sweat on the walls

Cages and poles

Call off the search for your soul

Or put it on hold again

She's having a sly indoor smoke

And she calls the folks who run this, her oldest friends

Sipping a drink and laughing at imaginary jokes

As all the signals are sent, her eyes invite you to approach

And it seems as though those lumps in your throat

That you just swallowed have got you going

Come on, come on, come on

Come on, come on, come on

Number one party anthem

She's a certified mind blower

Knowing full well that I don't

May suggest there's somewhere from which I might know her

Just to get the ball to roll

Drunken monologues, confused because

It's not like I'm falling in love, I just want ya

To do me no good

And you look like you could

Come on, come on, come on

Come on, come on, come on

Number one party anthem

Come on, come on, come on

Before the moment's gone

Number one party anthem, yeah, yeah

The look of love, the rush of blood

The "She's with me"'s, the Gallic shrug

The shutterbugs, the Camera Plus

The black & white and the color dodge

The good time girls, the cubicles

The house of fun, the number one

Party anthem, oh

Come on, come on, come on

Come on, come on, come on

Come on, come on, come on

Come on, come on, come on

Before the moment's gone

Number one party anthem

Number one party anthem

Number one party anthem

Yeah, yeah





### Mad Sounds



Mad sounds in your ears

Make you feel alright

They bring you back to life

Mad sounds in your ears

Make you get up and dance

They make you get up

Yeah, they make you get up

Love buckles under the strain

Of those wild nights

Run, but you can not hide

Mad sounds in your ears

Make you get up and dance

They make you get up

All night long, they reappear

Make you get up and dance

Yeah, they make you get up

Suppose you've gotta do what you've gotta do

We just weren't feeling how we wanted to

You sit and try sometimes, but you just can't figure out what went wrong

Then, out of nowhere, somebody comes and hits you with an

Ooh, la-la-la, ooh, la-la-la

Ooh, la-la-la, ooh

Ooh, la-la-la, ooh, la-la-la

Ooh, la-la-la, ooh

You got those mad sounds in your ears

To make you get up and dance

Mad sounds in your ears

They make you get up and dance

Hold on to make you get up

Ah, yeah, they make you get up

(Hallelujah)

Ooh, la-la-la, ooh, la-la-la

Ooh, la-la-la, ooh





### Fireside



I can't explain but I wanna try

There's this image of you and I

And it goes dancing by

In the morning and in the night time

There's all these secrets that I can't keep

Like in my heart there's that hotel suite

And you lived there so long

It's kinda strange, now you're gone

I'm not sure if I should

(Shoo-wop, shoo-wop) Show you what I've found

Has it gone for good? (Shoo-wop, shoo-wop)

Or is it coming back around? (Shoo-wop, shoo-wop)

Isn't it hard to make up your mind? (Shoo-wop, shoo-wop)

(Shoo-wop, shoo-wop) When you're losing

And your fuse is fireside? (Shoo-wop, shoo-wop)

There's all those places we used to go

And I suspect you already know

But that place on memory lane you like still looks the same

But something about it's changed

I'm not sure if I should

(Shoo-wop, shoo-wop) Show you what I've found

Has it gone for good? (Shoo-wop, shoo-wop)

Or is it coming back around? (Shoo-wop, shoo-wop)

Isn't it hard to make up your mind? (Shoo-wop, shoo-wop)

(Shoo-wop, shoo-wop) When you're losing

And your fuse is fireside? (Shoo-wop, shoo-wop)

And I thought I was yours (shoo-wop, shoo-wop)

Forever (shoo-wop, shoo-wop)

Or maybe I was mistaken (shoo-wop, shoo-wop)

But I just cannot manage (shoo-wop, shoo-wop)

To make it through the day (shoo-wop, shoo-wop)

Without thinking of you lately

I'm not sure if I should

(Shoo-wop, shoo-wop) Show you what I've found

Has it gone for good? (Shoo-wop, shoo-wop)

Or is it coming back around? (Shoo-wop, shoo-wop)

Isn't it hard to make up your mind? (Shoo-wop, shoo-wop)

(Shoo-wop, shoo-wop) When you're losing

And your fuse is fireside? (Shoo-wop, shoo-wop)





### Why'd You Only Call Me When You're High?



The mirror's image, it tells me it's home time

But I'm not finished, 'cause you're not by my side

And as I arrived I thought I saw you leavin', carryin' your shoes

Decided that once again I was just dreamin' of bumpin' into you

Now it's three in the mornin' and I'm tryin' to change your mind

Left you multiple missed calls and to my message, you reply

"Why'd you only call me when you're high?"

"Hi, why'd you only call me when you're high?"

Somewhere darker, talkin' the same shite

I need a partner, well, are you out tonight?

It's harder and harder to get you to listen

More I get through the gears

Incapable of makin' alright decisions, and havin' bad ideas

Now it's three in the mornin' and I'm tryin' to change your mind

Left you multiple missed calls and to my message you reply

"Why'd you only call me when you're high?"

"Hi, why'd you only call me when you're high?"

And I can't see you here, wonderin' where am I

It sort of feels like I'm runnin' out of time

I haven't found all I was hopin' to find

You said you gotta be up in the mornin'

Gonna have an early night

And you're startin' to bore me, baby

Why'd you only call me when you're high?

"Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?"

"Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?"

"Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?"

"Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?"



### Snap Out of It



What's been happenin' in your world?

What have you been up to?

I heard that you fell in love or near enough

I gotta tell you the truth, yeah

I wanna grab both your shoulders and shake, baby

Snap out of it (snap out of it)

I get the feelin' I left it too late, but baby

Snap out of it (snap out of it)

If that watch don't continue to swing

Or the fat lady fancies havin' a sing

I'll be here waitin' ever so patiently

For you to snap out of it

Forever isn't for everyone

Is forever for you?

It sounds like settlin' down or givin' up

But it don't sound much like you, girl

I wanna grab both your shoulders and shake, baby

Snap out of it (snap out of it)

I get the feelin' I left it too late, but baby

Snap out of it (snap out of it)

If that watch don't continue to swing

Or the fat lady fancies havin' a sing

I'll be here waitin' ever so patiently

For you to snap out of it

Under a spell you're hypnotized (ooh)

Darlin', how could you be so blind?

I wanna grab both your shoulders and shake, baby

Snap out of it (snap out of it)

I get the feelin' I left it too late, but baby

Snap out of it (snap out of it)

If that watch don't continue to swing

Or the fat lady fancies havin' a sing

I'll be here waitin' ever so patiently

For you to snap out of it



### Knee Socks



You got the lights on in the afternoon

And the nights are drawn out long

And you're kissin' to cut through the gloom

With a cough-drop colored tongue

And you were sittin' in the corner with the coats all piled high

When I thought you might be mine

In a small world on an exceptionally rainy Tuesday night

In the right place and time

When the zeros line up on the 24-hour clock

When you know who's callin' even though the number is blocked

When you walked around your house wearin' my sky blue Lacoste

And your knee socks

Well, you cured my January blues

Yeah, you made it all alright

I got a feelin' I might have lit the very fuse

That you were tryin' not to light

You were a stranger in my phonebook I was actin' like I knew

'Cause I had nothin' to lose

When the winter's in full swing and your dreams just aren't coming true

Ain't it funny what you'll do?

When the zeros line up on the 24-hour clock

When you know who's callin' even though the number is blocked

When you walked around your house wearin' my sky blue Lacoste

And your knee socks

The late afternoon, he ghost in your room

That you always thought didn't approve of you knockin' boots

Never stopped you letting me get hold of the sweet spot

By the scruff of your knee socks

You and me could've been a team

Each had a half of a king and queen seat

Like the beginnin' of Mean Streets

You could be my baby (be my baby)

You and me could've been a team

Each had a half of a king and queen seat

Like the beginnin' of Mean Streets

You could be my baby (be my baby)

You and me could've been a team (all the zeros lined up)

Each had a half of a king and queen seat

Like the beginnin' of Mean Streets

You could be my baby (be my baby) (but the number's blocked)

You and me could've been a team

Each had a half of a king and queen seat (when you've come undone)

Like the beginnin' of Mean Streets

You could be my baby (be my baby)

When the zeros line up on the 24-hour clock (all the zeros lined up)

When you know who's callin' even though the number is blocked (but the number's blocked)

When you walked around your house wearin' my sky blue Lacoste

And your knee socks (when you've come undone)

When the zeros line up on the 24-hour clock (all the zeros lined up)

When you know who's callin' even though the number is blocked

When you walked around your house wearin' my sky blue Lacoste

And your knee socks

Knee socks

Knee socks





### I Wanna Be Yours



I wanna be your vacuum cleaner

Breathin' in your dust

I wanna be your Ford Cortina

I will never rust

If you like your coffee hot

Let me be your coffee pot

You call the shots, babe

I just wanna be yours

Secrets I have held in my heart

Are harder to hide than I thought

Maybe I just wanna be yours

I wanna be yours

I wanna be yours

Wanna be yours

Wanna be yours

Wanna be yours

Let me be your 'leccy meter

And I'll never run out

Let me be the portable heater

That you'll get cold without

I wanna be your setting lotion (wanna be)

Hold your hair in deep devotion (how deep?)

At least as deep as the Pacific Ocean

I wanna be yours

Secrets I have held in my heart

Are harder to hide than I thought

Maybe I just wanna be yours

I wanna be yours

I wanna be yours

Wanna be yours

Wanna be yours

Wanna be yours

Wanna be yours

Wanna be yours

Wanna be yours

Wanna be yours

Wanna be your vacuum cleaner (wanna be yours)

Breathin' in your dust (wanna be yours)

I wanna be your Ford Cortina (wanna be yours)

I will never rust (wanna be yours)

I just wanna be yours (wanna be yours)

I just wanna be yours (wanna be yours)

I just wanna be yours (wanna be yours)

### Fortnight

I was supposed to be sent away

But they forgot to come and get me

I was a functioning alcoholic

'Til nobody noticed my new aesthetic

All of this to say

I hope you're okay but you're the reason

And no one here's to blame

But what about your quiet treason?

And for a fortnight there we were

Forever running to you

Sometimes ask about the weather

Now you're in my backyard

Turned into good neighbors

Your wife waters flowers

I want to kill her

All my mornings are Mondays

Stuck in an endless February

I took the miracle move on drug

The effects were temporary

And I love you, it's ruining my life

I love you, it's ruining my life

I touched you for only a fortnight

I touched you, but I touched you

And for a fortnight there we were

Forever running to you

Sometimes ask about the weather

Now you're in my backyard

Turned into good neighbors

Your wife waters flowers

I want to kill her

And for a fortnight there we were

Together running to you

Sometimes come and tug my sweater

Now you're at the mailbox

Turned into good neighbors

My husband is cheating

I want to kill him

I love you, it's ruining my life

I love you, it's ruining my life

I touched you for only a fortnight

I touched you, I touched you

I love you, it's ruining my life

I love you, it's ruining my life

I touched you for only a fortnight

I touched you, I touched you

I've been calling ya but you won't pick up

'Nother fortnight lost in America

Move to Florida, buy the car you want

But it won't start up 'til you touch, touch, touch me

I've been calling ya but you won't pick up

Another fortnight lost in America

Move to Florida, buy the car you want

But it won't start up 'til I touch, touch, touch you



### The Tortured Poets Department

You left your typewriter at my apartment

Straight from the tortured poets department

I think some things I never say

Like, who uses typewriters anyway?

But you're in self-sabotage mode

Throwin' spikes down on the road

But I've seen this episode and still loved the show

Who else decodes you?

And who's gonna hold you like me?

And who's gonna know you if not me?

I laughed in your face and said

You're not Dylan Thomas, I'm not Patti Smith

This ain't the Chelsea Hotel, we're modern idiots

And who's gonna hold you like me?

Nobody, no-fucking-body, nobody

You smoked then ate seven bars of chocolate

We declared Charlie Puth should be a bigger artist

I scratch your head, you fall asleep

Like a tattooed Golden Retriever

But you awaken with dread, pounding nails in your head

But I've read this one where you come undone

I chose this cyclone with you

And who's gonna hold you like me? (Who's gonna hold you, who's gonna hold you?)

And who's gonna know you like me? (Who's gonna know you?)

I laughed in your face and said

You're not Dylan Thomas, I'm not Patti Smith

This ain't the Chelsea Hotel, we're modern idiots

And who's gonna hold you like me?

No-fucking-body, nobody (who's gonna hold you, who's gonna hold you?)

(Who's gonna hold you, gonna know you, won't control you?) Nobody

Sometimes I wonder if you're gonna screw this up with me

But you told Lucy you'd kill yourself if I ever leave

And I had said that to Jack about you so I felt seen

Everyone we know understands why it's meant to be

'Cause we're crazy

So tell me, who else is gonna know me?

At dinner, you take my ring off my middle finger

And put it on the one people put wedding rings on

And that's the closest I've come to my heart exploding

Who's gonna hold you? (Who?) Me

Who's gonna know you? (Who?) Me

And you're not Dylan Thomas, I'm not Patti Smith

This ain't the Chelsea Hotel, we're two idiots

Who's gonna hold you?

You left your typewriter at my apartment

Straight from the tortured poets department

Who else decodes you? (Who? Who?)

### My Boy Only Breaks His Favorite Toys

Oh, here we go again

The voices in his head

Called the rain to end

Our days of wild

The sickest army doll

Purchased at the mall

Rivulets descend my plastic smile

But you should have seen him when he first got me

My boy only breaks his favorite toys, toys, oh

I'm queen of sandcastles he destroys, oh, oh

'Cause it fit too right

Puzzle pieces in the dead of night

I should've known it was a matter of time, oh, oh

My boy only breaks his favorite toys, oh, oh

There was a litany of reasons why

We could've played for keeps this time

I know I'm just repeating myself

Put me back on my shelf

But first, pull the string

And I'll tell you that he runs because he loves me (he loves me)

'Cause you should have seen him when he first saw me

My boy only breaks his favorite toys, toys, oh

I'm queen of sandcastles he destroys, oh, oh

'Cause I'm in too much

There was danger in the heat of my touch

He saw forever, so he smashed it up, oh, oh

My boy only breaks his favorite toys, oh, oh

once I fix me

(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh) he's gonna miss me

(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh) once I fix me

(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh) he's gonna miss me

Just say when, I'd play again

He was my best friend, down at the sandlot

I felt more when we played pretend

Than with all the Kens 'cause

He took me out of my box

He stole my tortured heart

Left all these broken parts

And told me I'm better off

But I'm not

I'm not

I'm not



### Down Bad

Did you really beam me up?

In a cloud of sparkling dust

Just to do experiments on

Tell me I was the chosen one

Show me that this world is bigger than us

Then sent me back where I came from

For a moment I knew cosmic love

Now I'm down bad crying at the gym

Everything comes out teenage petulance

"What if I can't have him"

"I might just die, it would make no difference."

Down bad, waking up in blood

Staring at the sky, come back and pick me up

What if I can't have us.

I might just not get up

I might stay down bad

What if I can't have him

Down bad

What if I can't have him

Did you take all my old clothes?

Just to leave me here naked and alone

In a field in my same old town

That somehow seems so hollow now

They'll say I'm nuts if I talk about the existence of you

For a moment I was heaven struck

Now I'm down bad crying at the gym

Everything comes out teenage petulance

"What if I can't have him"

"I might just die, it would make no difference."

Down bad, waking up in blood

Staring at the sky, come back and pick me up

What if I can't have us.

I might just not get up

I might stay down bad

Like I lost my twin

What if I can't have him

Down bad

Down bad

Waving at the ship

What if I can't have him

I loved your hostile takeovers

Encounters closer and closer

All your indecent exposures

How dare you say that it's -

I'll build you a fort on some planet

Where they can all understand it

How dare you think it's romantic

Leaving me safe and stranded

Cause what if I was in love

What if I can't have us.

Cause what if I was in love

Now I'm down bad crying at the gym

Everything comes out teenage petulance

"What if I can't have him"

"I might just die, it would make no difference."

Down bad, waking up in blood

Staring at the sky, come back and pick me up

What if I can't have us.

I might just not get up

I might stay down bad

Like I lost my twin

What if I can't have him

Down bad

Down bad

Waving at the ship

What if I can't have him

Like I lost my twin

What if I can't have him

Down bad

Waving at the ship

What if I can't have him



### So Long, London

So (so) long (long)

Lon- (Lon-), -don (-don)

So (so) long (long)

Lon- (Lon-), -don (-don)

So (so) long (long)

Lon- (Lon-), -don (-don)

I saw in my mind ferry lights through the mist

I kept calm and carried the weight of the rift

Pulled him in tighter each time he was drifting away

My spine split from carrying us up the hill

Wet through my clothes, weary bones caught the chill

I stopped trying to make him laugh, stopped trying to drill the safe

Thinking, how much sad did you

Think I had, did you

Think I had in me?

Oh, the tragedy

So long London

You'll find someone

I didn't opt in to be your odd man out

I founded the club she's heard great things about

I left all I knew you left me at the house by the Heath

I stopped CPR, after all, it's no use

The spirit was gone, we would never come to

And I'm pissed off you let me give you all that youth for free

For so long, London

Stitches undone

Two graves, one gun

I'll find someone

And you say I abandoned the ship, but I was going down with it

My white knuckle dying grip holding tight to your quiet resentment

And my friends said it isn't right to be scared

Every day old love affair

Every breath feels like rarest air

When you're not sure if he wants to be there

So how much sad did you think I had, did you think I had in me?

How much tragedy?

Just how low did you think I'd go 'fore I'd self implode?

'Fore I'd have to go be free?

You swore that you loved me, but where were the clues?

I died on the altar waiting for the proof

You sacrificed us to the gods of your bluest days

And I'm just getting color back into my face

I'm just mad as hell 'cause I loved this place

For so long, London

Had a good run

A moment of warm sun

But I'm not the one

So long, London

Stitches undone

Two graves, one gun

You'll find someone



### But Daddy I Love Him

I forget how the West was won

I forget if this was ever fun

I just learned these people only raise you to cage you

Sarahs and Hannahs in their Sunday best

Clutching their pearls, sighing, "What a mess"

I just learned these people try and save you

'Cause they hate you

Too high a horse for a simple girl to rise above it

They slammed the door on my whole world

The one thing I wanted

Now I'm running with my dress unbuttoned

Screaming, "But daddy I love him

I'm having his baby"

No, I'm not, but you should see your faces

I'm telling him to floor it through the fences

No, I'm not coming to my senses

I know he's crazy, but he's the one I want

Dutiful daughter, all my plans were laid

Tendrils tucked into a woven braid

Growing up precocious sometimes means not growing up at all

He was chaos, he was revelry

Bedroom eyes like a remedy

Soon enough the elders had convened down at the City Hall

"Stay away from her"

The saboteurs protested too much

Lord knows the words we never heard

Just screeching tires and true love

And I'm running with my dress unbuttoned

Screaming, "But daddy, I love him

I'm having his baby"

No, I'm not, but you should see your faces

I'm telling him to floor it through the fences

No, I'm not coming to my senses

I know he's crazy, but he's the one I want

I'll tell you something right now

I'd rather burn my whole life down

Than listen to one more second of all this bitching and moaning

I'll tell you something about my good name

It's mine alone to disgrace

I don't cater to all these vipers dressed in empath's clothing

God save the most judgmental creeps who say they want

What's best for me Sanctimoniously performing soliloquies I'll never see

Thinking it can change the beat of my heart when he touches me

And counteract the chemistry and undo the destiny

You ain't gotta pray for me

Me and my wild boy and all this wild joy

If all you want is grey for me

Then it's just white noise, then it's just my choice

There's a lotta people in town that I bestow upon my fakest smiles

Scandal does funny things to pride but brings lovers closer

We came back when the heat died down, went to my parents and they came around

All the wine moms are still holding out but fuck 'em, it's over

Now I'm dancing in my dress in the sun and even my daddy just loves him

I'm his lady and oh my God, you should see your faces

Time, doesn't it give some perspective?

And no, you can't come to the wedding

I know he's crazy but he's the one I want

I'll tell you something right now

You ain't gotta pray for me, me and my wild boy and all this wild joy

(He was chaos, he was revelry)

If all you want is grey for me, then it's just white noise, it's my choice

Screaming, "But daddy I love him"

I'm having his baby, no, I'm not

But you should see your faces

But oh my God, you should see your faces

(He was chaos, he was revelry)



### Fresh Out the Slammer

Now pretty baby I'm runnin back home to you

Fresh out the slammer

I know who my first call will be to ...

Fresh out the slammer

Another summer, taking cover

Rolling thunder, he don't understand me

Splintered back in winter

Silent dinners, bitter

He was with her in dreams

Gray and blue and fights and tunnels

Handcuffed to the spell I was under

For just one hour of sunshine

Years of labor, locks and ceilings

In the shade of how he was feeling

But it's gonna be alright. I did my time.

Now pretty baby I'm runnin back home to you

Fresh out the slammer

I know who my first call will be to ...

Fresh out the slammer

Camera flashes, welcome bashes

Get the matches, toss the ashes off the ledge

As I said in my letters, now that I know better

I will never lose my baby again

My friends tried but I wouldn't hear it

Watched me daily disappearing

For just one glimpse of his smile

All those nights you kept me going

Swirled you into all of my poems

Now we're at the starting line

I did my time.

Now pretty baby I'm running

To the house where you still wait up

And that porch light gleams

To the one who says

I'm the girl of his American Dreams

And no matter what I've done

It wouldn't matter anyway

Ain't no way I'm gonna screw up

Now that I know what's at stake

Here. At the park where we used to sit on children's swings

Wearing imaginary rings ...

But it's gonna be alright.

I did my time ...



### Florida!!!

You can beat the heat if you beat the charges too

They said I was a cheat, I guess it must be true

And my friends all smell like weed or little babies

And this city reeks of driving myself crazy

Little did you know

Your home's really only a town you're just a guest in

So you work your life away

Just to pay for a timeshare down in Destin

Florida, is one hell of a drug

Florida, can I use you up?

A hurricane with my name, when it came

I got drunk and I dared it to wash me away

Barricaded in the bathroom with a bottle of wine

Well, me and my ghosts, we had a hell of a time

Yes, I'm haunted but I'm feeling just fine

All my girls got their lace and their crimes

And your cheating husband disappeared

Well, no one asks any questions here

So I did my best to lay to rest

All of the bodies that have ever been on my body

And in my mind, they sink into the swamp

Is that a bad thing to say in a song?

Little did you know

Your home's really only the town you'll get arrested

So you pack your life away

Just to wait out the shitstorm back in Texas

Florida, is one hell of a drug

Florida, can I use you up?

I need to forget, so take me to Florida

I've got some regrets, I'll bury them in Florida

Tell me I'm despicable, say it's unforgivable

At least the dolls are beautiful, fuck me up Florida

I need to forget, so take me to Florida

I've got some regrets, I'll bury them in Florida

Tell me I'm despicable, say it's unforgivable

What a crush, what a rush, fuck me up Florida

It's one hell of a drug

It's one hell of a drug

Love me like this and I don't want to exist

So take me to Florida

Little did you know

Your home's really only a town you're just a guest in

So you work your life away

Just to pay for a timeshare down in Destin (take me to Florida)

Little did you know

Your home's really only the town you'll get arrested in

So you pack your life away

Just to wait out the shitstorm back in Texas

Florida, is one hell of a drug (take me to)

Florida, can I use you up?

Florida, is one hell of a drug

Florida, go on, fuck me up



### Guilty as Sin?

Drowning in the Blue Nile

He sent me 'Downtown Lights'

I hadn't heard it in a while

My boredom's bone deep

This cage was once just fine

Am I allowed to cry?

I dream of cracking locks

Throwing my life to the wolves

Or the ocean rocks

Crashing into him tonight

He's a paradox

I'm seeing visions, am I bad?

Or mad? Or wise?

What if he's written 'mine' on my upper thigh

Only in my mind?

One slip and falling back into the hedge maze

Oh what a way to die

I keep recalling things we never did

Messy top lip kiss

How I long for our trysts

Without ever touching his skin

How can I be guilty as sin?

I keep these longings locked

In lowercase inside a vault

Someone told me

There's no such thing as bad thoughts

Only your actions talk

These fatal fantasies

Giving way to labored breath

Taking all of me

We've already done it in my head

If it's make believe

Why does it feel like a vow

We'll both uphold somehow?

What if he's written 'mine' on my upper thigh

Only in my mind?

One slip and falling back into the hedge maze

Oh what a way to die

My bedsheets are ablaze

I've screamed his name

Building up like waves

Crashing over my grave

Without ever touching his skin

How can I be guilty as sin?

What if I roll the stone away?

They're gonna crucify me anyway

What if the way you hold me

Is actually what's holy?

If long suffering propriety

Is what they want from me

They don't know how you've haunted me

So stunningly

I choose you and me

... Religiously

What if he's written 'mine' on my upper thigh

Only in my mind?

One slip and falling back into the hedge maze

Oh what a way to die

I keep recalling things we never did

Messy top lip kiss

How I long for our trysts

Without ever touching his skin

How can I be guilty as sin?

He sent me 'Downtown Lights'

I hadn't heard it in a while

Am I allowed to cry?

### Whoâs Afraid of Little Old Me?

â¦ The who's who of who's that?

Is poised for the attack

But my bare hands paved their paths

You don't get to tell me about sad

â¦ If you wanted me dead, you should've just said

Nothing makes me feel more alive

â¦ So I leap from the gallows and I levitate down your street

Crash the party like a record scratch as I scream

Who's afraid of little old me?

You should be

â¦ The scandal was contained

The bullet had just grazed

At all costs, keep your good name

You don't get to tell me you feel bad

â¦ Is it a wonder I broke? Let's hear one more joke

Then we could all just laugh until I cry

â¦ So I leap from the gallows and I levitate down your street

Crash the party like a record scratch as I scream

Who's afraid of little old me?

I was tame, I was gentle 'til the circus life made me mean

Don't you worry folks, we took out all her teeth

Who's afraid of little old me?

â¦ Well, you should be (you should be)

You should be (you should be)

You should be

You should be (you should be)

You should be (you should be)

You should be

â¦ So tell me everything is not about me

But what if it is?

Then say they didn't do it to hurt me

But what if they did?

â¦ I wanna snarl and show you just how disturbed this has made me

You wouldn't last an hour in the asylum where they raised me

So all you kids can sneak into my house with all the cobwebs

I'm always drunk on my own tears, isn't that what they all say?

â¦ That I'll sue you if you step on my lawn

That I'm fearsome and I'm wretched and I'm wrong

Putting narcotics into all of my songs

And that's why you're still singing along

â¦ So I leap from the gallows and I levitate down your street

Crash the party like a record scratch as I scream

Who's afraid of little old me?

I was tame, I was gentle 'til the circus life made me mean

Don't you worry folks, we took out all her teeth

Who's afraid of little old me?

â¦ Well, you should be (you should be)

You should be (you should be)

You should be

'Cause you lured me (you should be)

And you hurt me (you should be)

And you taught me

â¦ You caged me and then you called me crazy

I am what I am 'cause you trained me

So who's afraid of me?

Who's afraid of little old me?

Who's afraid of little old me?

### I Can Fix Him (No Really I Can)

The smoke cloud billows out his mouth

Like a freight train through a small town

The jokes that he told across the bar

Were revolting and far too loud

They shake their heads saying, "God help her"

When I tell them he's my man

But your good lord doesn't need to lift a finger

I can fix him, no, really I can

And only I can

The dopamine races through his brain

On a six lane Texas highway

His hands, so calloused from his pistol

Softly traces hearts on my face

And I could see it from a mile away

A perfect case for my certain skillset

He had a halo of the highest grade

He just hadn't met me yet

They shake their heads saying, "God help her"

When I tell them he's my man

But your good lord doesn't need to lift a finger

I can fix him, no, really, I can

And only I can

Good boy, that's right

Come close, I'll show you heaven

If you'll be an angel, all mine

Trust me, I can handle me a dangerous man

No, really I can

They shook their heads saying, "God help her"

When I tell them he's my man (I told them he's my man)

But your good lord didn't need to lift a finger

I can fix him, no, really I can (no, really I can)

Whoa, maybe I can't

### loml

Who's gonna stop us from waltzing back into rekindled flames

If we know the steps anyway?

We embroidered the memories of the time I was away

Stitching, we were just kids, babe

I said, I don't mind, it takes time

I thought I was better safe than starry eyed

I felt a glow like this

Never before and never since

If you know it in one glimpse, it's legendary

You and I go from one kiss to getting married

Still alive, killing time at the cemetery

Never quite buried in your suit and tie

In the nick of time

You low down boy, you stand up guy, you holy ghost

You told me I'm the love of your life

You said I'm the love of your life

About a million times

Who's gonna tell me the truth

When you blew in with the winds of fate

And told me I reformed you?

When your impressionist paintings of heaven turned out to be fakes

You took me to hell too

And all at once the ink bleeds

A conman sells a fool a get love quick scheme

But I felt a hole like this

Never before and never since

If you know it in one glimpse, it's legendary

What we thought was for all time, was momentary

Still alive, killing time at the cemetery

Never quite buried

You cinephile in black and white

All those plot twists and dynamite

Mister Steal-Your-Girl then make her cry

You said I'm the love of your life

You shit talked me under the table

Talking rings and talking cradles

I wish I could un-recall how we almost had it all

Dancing phantoms on the terrace

Are they secondhand embarrassed

That I can't get out of bed

'Cause something counterfeit's dead?

It was legendary

It was momentary

It was unnecessary

Should've let it stay buried

Oh, what a valiant roar, what a bland goodbye

A coward claimed he was a lion

I'm combing through the braids of lies

I'll never leave, never mind

Our field of dreams engulfed in fire

Your arsons match your somber eyes

And I'll still see it until I die

You're the loss of my life

### I Can Do It With a Broken Heart

I can read your mind

She's having the time of her life

There in her glittering prime

The lights refract sequined stars off her silhouette every night

I can show you lies (one, two, three)

'Cause I'm a real tough kid, I can handle my shit

They said, baby, gotta fake it 'til you make it and I did

Lights, camera, bitch smile, even when you wanna die

He said he'd love me all his life

But that life was too short

Breaking down, I hit the floor

All the pieces of me shattered as the crowd was chanting, "More"

I was grinning like I'm winning, I was hitting my marks

'Cause I can do it with a broken heart (one, two, three)

I'm so depressed, I act like it's my birthday every day

I'm so obsessed with him but he avoids me like the plague

I cry a lot but I am so productive, it's an art

You know you're good when you can even do it

With a broken heart

I can hold my breath

I've doing it since he left

I keep finding his things in drawers

Crucial evidence I didn't imagine the whole thing

I'm sure I can pass this test (one, two, thee)

'Cause I'm a real tough kid, I can handle my shit

They said, baby, gotta fake it 'til you make it and I did

Lights, camera, bitch smile, in stilettos for miles

He said he'd love me for all time

But that time was quite short

Breaking down, I hit the floor

All the pieces of me shattered as the crowd was chanting, "More"

I was grinning like I'm winning, I was hitting my marks

'Cause I can do it with a broken heart (one, two, three)

I'm so depressed, I act like it's my birthday every day

I'm so obsessed with him but he avoids me like the plague (he avoids me)

I cry a lot but I am so productive, it's an art

You know you're good when you can even do it

With a broken heart

You know you're good when you can even do it

With a broken heart

You know you're good, I'm good

'Cause I'm miserable

And no one even knows

Try to come for my job



### The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived

Was any of it true?

Gazing at me starry-eyed

In your Jehovah's Witness suit

Who the hell was that guy?

You tried to buy some pills

From a friend of friends of mine

They just ghosted you

Now, you know what it feels like

And I don't even want you back

I just want to know

If rusting my sparkling summer was the goal

And I don't miss what we had

But could someone give

A message to the smallest man who ever lived?

You hung me on your wall

Stabbed me with your push pins

In public, showed me off

Then, sank in stoned oblivion

'Cause once your queen had come

You'd treat her like an also-ran

You didn't measure up

In any measure of a man

And I don't even want you back

I just want to know

If rusting my sparkling summer was the goal

And I don't miss what we had

But could someone give

A message to the smallest man who ever lived?

Were you sent by someone

Who wanted me dead?

Did you sleep with a gun underneath our bed?

Were you writing a book?

Were you a sleeper cell spy?

In 50 years will all this be declassified?

And you'll confess why you did it

And I'll say, "Good riddance"

'Cause it wasn't sexy once it wasn't forbidden

I would've died for your sins

Instead, I just died inside

And you deserve prison, but you won't get time

You'll slide into inboxes

And slip through the bars

You crashed my party and your rental car

You said, "Normal girls were boring"

But you were gone by the morning

You kicked out the stage lights

But you're still performing

And in plain sight you hid

But you are what you did

And I'll forget you, but

I'll never forgive

The smallest man who ever lived

### The Alchemy

This happens once every few lifetimes

These chemicals hit me like white wine

What if I told you I'm back?

The hospital was a drag

Worst sleep that I ever had

I circled you on a map

I haven't come around in so long

But I'm coming back so strong

So when I touch down

Call the amateurs and

Cut 'em from the team

Ditch the clowns, get the crown

Baby I'm the one to beat

Cause the sign on your heart

Said it's still reserved for me

Honestly, who are we to fight the alchemy?

Hey you, what if I told you we're cool?

That child's play back in school

Is forgiven under my rule

I haven't come around in so long

But I'm making a comeback to where I belong ...

So when I touch down

Call the amateurs and

Cut 'em from the team

Ditch the clowns, get the crown

Baby I'm the one to beat

Cause the sign on your heart

Said it's still reserved for me

Honestly, who are we to fight the alchemy?

These blokes warm the benches

We been on a winning streak

He jokes that it's heroin but this time with an "E"

Cause the sign on your heart said it's still reserved for me

Honestly, who are we to fight the alchemy?

Shirts off, and your friends lift you up over their heads

Beer sticking to the floor

Cheers chanted, cause they said

There was no chance, trying to be

The greatest in the league

Where's the trophy?

He just comes running over to me

Touch down

Call the amateurs and

Cut 'em from the team

Ditch the clowns, get the crown

Baby I'm the one to beat

Cause the sign on your heart

Said it's still reserved for me

Honestly, who are we to fight the alchemy?

These blokes warm the benches

We been on a winning streak

He jokes that it's heroin but this time with an "E"

Cause the sign on your heart said it's still reserved for me

Honestly, who are we to fight the alchemy?

This happens once every few lifetimes

These chemicals hit me like white wine



### Clara Bow

You look like Clara Bow

In this light, remarkable

All your life, did you know

You'd be picked like a rose?

I'm not trying to exaggerate

But I think I might die if it happened

Die if it happened to me

No one in my small town

Thought I'd see the lights of Manhattan

This town is fake but you're the real thing

Breath of fresh air through smoke rings

Take the glory, give everything

Promise to be dazzling

You look like Stevie Nicks

In '75, the hair and lips

Crowd goes wild, at our fingertips

Half moon shine, a full eclipse

I'm not trying to exaggerate

But I think I might die if I made it

Die if I made it

No one in my small town

Thought I'd need these suits in LA

They all wanna say

This town is fake but you're the real thing

Breath of fresh air through smoke rings

Take the glory, give everything

Promise to be dazzling

The crown is stained but you're the real queen

Flesh and blood amongst war machines

You're the new god we're worshipping

Promise to be dazzling

Beauty is a beast that roars

Down on all fours, demanding more

Only when your girlish glow flickers just so

Do they let you know

It's hell on earth to be heavenly

Them's the breaks, they don't come gently

You look like Taylor Swift

In this light, we're loving it

You've got edge she never did

The future's bright, dazzling



### The Bolter

By all accounts, she almost drowned

When she was six in frigid water

And I can confirm she made

A curious child, ever reviled

By everyone except her own father

With a quite bewitching face

Splendidly selfish, charmingly helpless

Excellent fun 'til you get to know her

Then she runs like it's a race

Behind her back, her best mates laughed

And they nicknamed her "The Bolter"

Started with a kiss

"Oh, we must stop meeting like this"

But it always ends up with a Town Car speeding

Out the drive one evening

Ended with the slam of a door

Then he'll call her a whore

Wish he wouldn't be sore

But as she was leaving

It felt like breathing

All her fuckin' lives

Flashed before her eyes

It feels like the time

She fell through the ice

Then came out alive

He was a cad, wanted her bad

Just like any good trophy hunter

And she likes the way it tastes

Taming a bear, making him care

Watching him jump then pulling him under

And at first blush, this is fate

When it's all roses, portrait poses

Central Park Lake in tiny rowboats

What a charming Saturday

That's when she sees the littlest leaks

Down in the floorboards

And she just knows

She must bolt

Started with a kiss

"Oh, we must stop meeting like this"

But it always ends up with a Town Car speeding

Out the drive one evening

Ended with the slam of a door

Then he'll call her a whore

Wish he wouldn't be sore

But as she was leaving

It felt like breathing

All her fuckin' lives

Flashed before her eyes

It feels like the time

She fell through the ice

Then came out alive

She's been many places with

Men of many faces

First, they're off to the races

And she's laughing drawin' aces

But, none of it is changin'

That the chariot is waitin'

Hearts are hers for the breakin'

There's an escape in escaping

Started with a kiss

"Oh, we must stop meeting like this"

But it always ends up with a Town Car speeding

Out the drive one evening

Ended with the slam of a door

But she's got the best stories

You can be sure

That as she was leaving

It felt like freedom

All her fuckin' lives

Flashed before her eyes

(And she realized)

It feels like the time

She fell through the ice

Then came out alive

### AMERIICAN REQUIEM

Nothin' really ends

For things to stay the same, they have to change again

Hello, my old friend

You change your name, but not the ways you play pretend

American requiem

Them big ideas (yeah) are buried here (yeah)

Amen

It's a lot of talkin' goin' on

While I sing my song

Can you hear me?

I said: Do you hear me?

Looka dere, looka dere, now

Looka dere, looka dere

Looka-looka, looka dere, looka dere

Looka-looka, looka dere, looka dere

Looka-looka, looka dere, looka dere (oh, yeah)

Looka-looka, looka dere, looka dere

It's a lotta chatter in here

But let me make myself clear (oh)

Can you hear me? (Huh)

Or do you fear me? (Wow)

Can we stand for something?

Now is the time to face the wind (ow)

Covered in peace and love, y'all

Oh, a lotta takin' up space

Salty tears beyond my gaze

Can you stand me?

(Can you stand me? Can you stand me? Can you stand me?) Ooh, ah

(Can you stand me? Can you stand me? Can you stand me?) Can we stand?

(Can you stand me? Can you stand me? Can you stand me?) Can you stand with me?

Can we stand for something?

Now is the time to face the wind

Now ain't the time to pretend

Now is the time to let love in

Thinkin' to myself (to myself) (oh)

Thereâs a lot of talkin' goin' on (oh)

While I sing my song (yeah)

Do you hear me when I say?

Do you hear me when I say?

Looka dere, looka dere

Looka, look

Looka-looka-looka-looka-looka

Looka-looka dere, looka dere

L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-looka dere

Oh, looka dere, looka dere

Looka dere, looka dere

(Can you stand me? Can you stand me? Can you stand me?) La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

(Can you stand me? Can you stand me? Can you stand me?)

Can we stand for something?

Now is the time to face the wind (now is the time to face the wind)

Now ain't the time to pretend

Now is the time to let love in (to let love in)

Together, can we stand?

Looka dere, looka in my hand

The grandbaby of a moonshine man

Gadsden, Alabama

Got folk down in Galveston, rooted in Louisiana

They used to say I spoke too country

Then the rejection came, said I wasn't country enough

Said I wouldn't saddle up, but

If that ain't country, tell me, what is?

Plant my bare feet on solid ground for years

They don't, don't know how hard I had to fight for this

When I sang my song

(When I sang the song of Abraham)

(When the angels guide and take my hand)

(Oh, no)

Goodbye to what has been

A pretty house that we never settled in

A funeral for fair-weather friends

I am the one to cleanse me of my fatherâs sins

American requiem

Them big ideas (yeah) are buried here (yeah)

Amen

### BLACKBIIRD

Blackbird singing in the dead of night

Take these broken wings and learn to fly

All your life

You were only waiting for this moment to arise

Blackbird singing in the dead of night

Take these sunken eyes and learn to see

All your life

You were only waiting for this moment to be

All your life

You were only waiting for this moment to arise

Blackbird singing in the dead of night

Take these broken eyes and learn to see

All your life

You were only waiting for this moment to be

All your life

You were only waiting for this moment to be

All your life

You were only waiting for this moment to be

### CARRIAGES

Sixteen carriages drivin' away

While I watch them ride with my dreams away

To the summer sunset on a holy night

On a long black road, all the tears I fight

Sixteen carriages drivin' away

While I watch them ride with my dreams away

To the summer sunset on a holy night

On a long black road, all the tears I fight

At fifteen, the innocence was gone astray

Had to leave my home at an early age

I saw Mama prayin', I saw Daddy grind

All my tender problems, had to leave behind

It's been umpteen summers and I'm not in my bed

On the back of the bus and a bunk with the band

Goin' so hard, gotta choose myself

Underpaid and overwhelmed

I might cook, clean, but still won't fold

Still workin' on my life, you know

Only God knows, only God knows

Only God knows

Sixteen carriages drivin' away

While I watch them ride with my fears away

To the summer sunset on a holy night

On a long back road, all the tears I fight

Sixteen carriages drivin' away

While I watch them ride with my fears away

To the summer sunset on a holy night

On a long back road, all the tears I fight

Sixteen dollars, workin' all day

Ain't got time to waste, I got art to make

I got love to create on this holy night

They won't dim my light, all these years I fight

It's been thirty-eight summers and I'm not in my bed

On the back of the bus and a bunk with the band

Goin' so hard, now I miss my kids

Overworked and overwhelmed

I might cook, clean, but still won't fold

Still workin' on my life, you know

Only God knows, only God knows

Only God knows

Sixteen carriages driving away

While I watch them ride with my fears away

To the summer sunset on a holy night

On a long back road, all the tears I fight

Sixteen carriages driving away

While I watch them ride with my fears away

To the summer sunset on a holy night

On a long back road, all these tears I fight

Ooh, ooh

Ooh

At fifteen, the innocence was gone astray

Had to take care of home at an early age

I saw Mama cryin', I saw Daddy lyin'

Had to sacrifice and leave my fears behind

The legacy, if it's the last thing I do

You'll remember me 'cause we got somethin' to prove

In your memory, on a highway to truth

Still see our faces when you close your eyes

Sixteen carriages drivin' away

While I watch them ride with my dreams away

### PROTECTOR

Mom, can I hear the lullaby, please?

And there I was, tangled up in marigold

We were listening to the reverend children singing

(Sing, sing, sing, sing) hm, yeah

Hummin' low as the garden river flows

While the August light becomes a golden evenin' (evenin'), yeah

And I will lead you down that road if you lose your way

Born to be a protector, mm-hmm

Even though I know someday you're gonna shine on your own

I will be your projector, mm, mm-hmm

An apricot picked right off a given tree

I gave water to the soil, and now it feeds me, yeah, yeah (yeah)

And there you are, shaded underneath it all

I feel proud of who I am, because you need me, yeah (yeah)

And I will lead you down that road if you lose your way (uh)

Born to be a protector-tor, mm

Even though I know someday you're gonna shine on your own

I will be your projector, mm-hm

And even though I know someday you're gonna shine on your own

I will be your projector, projector, projector

I first saw your face in your father's gaze

There's a long line of hands carryin' your name, mm

Liftin' you up, so you will be raised

Even though I know someday you're gonna shine on your own

I will be your projector, yeah

And even though I know someday you're gonna shine on your own

I will be your protector, born to be a protector

Okay

### MY ROSE

How many times have you let yourself get you down?

Let yourself get you down, my dear

So many roses but none to be picked without thorns

So be fond of your flaws, dear

La-la-la-la-la-la, love you

La-la-la-la-la-la, love you

La-la-la-la-la-la, I just hope you love yourself like that

And I really hope the best for you

You're my love, my sweetie pie, my baby, you're my heart

I hope

Oh, I hope

### DOLLY P

Jolene

Hey miss Honey B, it's Dolly P

You know that hussy with the good hair you sing about?

Reminding me of someone I knew back when

Except she has flamin' locks of auburn hair

Bless her heart

Just a hair of a different color, but it hurts just the same



### JOLENE

Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene

I'm warnin' you, don't come for my man (Jolene)

Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene

Don't take the chance because you think you can

You're beautiful beyond compare

Takes more than beauty and seductive stares

To come between a family and a happy man

Jolene, I'm a woman too

The games you play are nothing new

So you don't want no heat with me, Jolene

We been deep in love for twenty years

I raised that man, I raised his kids

I know my man better than he knows himself (uh, what?)

I can easily understand why you're attracted to my man

But you don't want this smoke

So shoot your shot with someone else (you heard me)

Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene

I'm warnin' you, woman, find you your own man

Jolene, I know I'm a queen, Jolene

I'm still a Creole banjee bitch from Louisiana (don't try me)

There's a thousand girls in every room

That act as desperate as you do

You a bird, go on and sing your tune, Jolene (what?)

I had to have this talk with you

'Cause I hate to have to act a fool

Your peace depends on how you move, Jolene

Me and my man crossed those valleys

Highs and lows and everything between

Good deeds roll in like tumbling weeds

I sleep good happy 'cause you can't dig up our planted seeds

I know my man's gon' stand by me breathing in my gentle breeze (ah)

I crossed those valleys

Highs and lows and everything between

Good deeds roll in like tumbling weeds

Sleep good and happy 'cause you can't dig up them planted seeds

Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene

I'ma stand by her, she gon' stand by me, Jolene

I'ma stand by him, he gon' stand by me

(I'ma stand by her, she gon' stand by me)

I'ma stand by him, he gon' stand by me, Jolene



### DAUGHTER

Your body laid out on these filthy floors

Your bloodstains on my custom coutures

Bathroom attendant let me right in

She was a big fan

I really tried to stay cool

But your arrogance disturbed my solitude

Now I ripped your dress and you're all black and blue

Look what you made me do

They keep sayin' that I ain't nothin' like my father

But I'm the furthest thing from choir boys and altars

If you cross me, I'm just like my father

I am colder than Titanic water

Help me, Lord, from these fantasies in my head

They ain't ever been safe ones

I don't fellowship with these fake ones

So let's travel to white chapels and sing hymns

Hold rosaries and sing in stained-glass symphonies

Cleanse me, Holy Trinity, from this marijuana smoke smell in my hair

I sashayed my dress

Did my best impression of a damsel in distress

This alcohol and smell of regret

Allured my catch

Outfit too small to hide my scars

Feelin' bottled up like bottle service broads

How long can he hold his breath before his death?

Caro mio ben

Credimi almen

Senza di te

Languisce il cor

Il tuo fedel

Sospira ognor

Cessa, crudel

Tanto rigor

Ooh

Ooh

Help me, Lord, from these fantasies in my head

They ain't ever been safe ones

I don't fellowship with these fake ones

So let's travel to white chapels and sing hymns

Hold rosaries, sing in stained-glass symphonies

Cleanse me, Holy Trinity, from this marijuana smoke smell in my hair

Say I'm nothin' like my father

But I'm the furthest thing from choir boys and altars

Double cross me, I'm just like my father

I am colder than Titanic water



### SPAGHETTII

Genres are a funny little concept, aren't they?

Yes, they are

That BeyoncÃ© Virgo shit

In theory, they have a simple definition that's easy to understand

But in practice, well, some may feel confined

I swear for God it's 'bout to hit

Jheeze, oh

Ah, woop-woop

Right (right, right)

Right (right, right), oh

I ain't in no gang but I got shooters and I bang-bang (goddamn)

At the snap of my fingers, I'm Thanos, damn it, damn it

And I'm still on your head, cornrows, damn it, damn it (right)

They call me the captain, the catwalk assassin (come on)

When they know it's slappin' then here come the yappin'

All of the snitchin' and all of this bitchin'

Just a fishin' expedition, dumb admission, in the kitchen

Cookin' up them chickens, extra leg, but I ain't even tryna kick it

Cunty, country, petty, petty, petty

All the same to me, Plain Jane, spaghetti

No sauce, no sauce, uh, too soft, too soft, uh

They salty, they shootin' like Curry (one, two, three)

One hand on my holster then pass it to Hova

Thought it was sweet when they was walkin' in the backdoor of the kitchen

Past the dirty dishes, now we on a mission

Tried to turn me to the opposition, I'm appalled 'bout the proposition

Y'all been played by the plagiaristic

Ain't gon' get no clout addiction, my attention

I ain't no regular singer, now come get everythin' you came for

I ain't in no gang, but I got shooters and I bang-bang (come on)

They still love your flame, ain't no game or I'll pierce your heart

I ain't in no gang, but I got shooters and I bang-bang

Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang (BeyoncÃ©, BeyoncÃ©, right here)

come get everythin' you came for

Ayy, howl to the moon (howl to the moon)

Howl to the moon

Outlaws with me, they gon' shoot

Keep the code, break the rules (break the rules)

We gon' ride for every member that we lose (yeah)

Someone here brought fire, ain't no tellin' who

Play it cool

Know the lawman watchin' me every time I move (move)

Bounty on my head, can't go west, they on my shoes

No matter what the charges is, we ain't gon' tell the truth



### ALLIGATOR TEARS

High tides in the city, I'm in too deep

And I'm runnin' on fear

Oh, dear, you and your alligator tears

Works me over and through

You say move a mountain, and I'll throw on my boots

You say stop the river from runnin', I'll build a dam or two

You say change religions, now I spend Sundays with you

Somethin' 'bout those tears of yours

How does it feel to be adored?

You and your alligator tears

You and those alligator tears

You

Somethin' about those tears of yours

How does it feel to be adored?

Sunrise in the morning, you're all I need

All I need is rain, or the roots get weak

Sweet things need time to grow

Think about leaving? Hell no

Squeeze every ounce of love on my body, yeah

You say move a mountain, and I'll throw on my boots

You say stop the river from runnin', I'll build a dam or two

You say change religion, now I spend Sundays with you

Somethin' 'bout those tears of yours

How does it feel to be adored?

those alligator tears

(I adore, I adore, I adore, I adore) your alligator tears

(I adore, I adore, I adore, I adore, I adore) alligator tears

Alligator tears

### SMOKE HOUR II

You're turned into KNTRY Radio, Texas

Home of the real deal

And if there's one thing you can take away from our set today, let it be this

Sometimes you don't know what you like

Until someone you trust, turns you on to some real good shit

And that, ladies and gentlemen, is why I'm here

Up next on the smoke hour is, "JUST FOR FUN" by BeyoncÃ©

You're welcome



### JUST FOR FUN

I'm goin' out loud just for fun, I am the man, I know it

And everywhere I go, they know my name

So I laugh and I lie and the coyotes cry

And uh, time moves quickly and so do I, so do I

So I'll say my goodbye

'Cause time heals everything

I don't need anything

Hallelujah

I pray to her

Here's to hoping I'll fall fast asleep tonight

And I'll just need to get through this

Born in the darkness, who brings the light?

And I just, I need to get through this

Oh, just getting used to it

I'm goin' down south just for fun, I am the man, I know it

And everywhere I go, I hide my face

From the cowboys in Clovis, and the rodeo circus

I came here for a reason, but I don't know the purpose

It's all under the surface

But time heals everything

I don't need anything

I lay low, yeah

I pray too, uh

Here's to hoping I'll fall fast asleep tonight

And I'll just need to get through this

Born in the darkness, who brings the light?

And I just, I need to get through this

Oh, just getting used to it

'Cause time heals everything

I don't need anything

Hallelujah

I pray to her (I pray to her)

This house was built with blood and bones

And it crumbled, yes, it crumbled

The statues they made were beautiful

But they were lies of stone, they were lies of stone

Trumpets blare, with silent sound

I need to make you proud

Tell me, can you hear me now?

Mercy on me, mercy, have mercy on me

(Mercy) yeah (mercy) yeah

I can see you hurtin', see you hurtin' badly

Can see you hurtin', see you hurtin' (mercy, mercy)

Say a prayer for what has been

We'll be the ones to purify our fathers' sins

American Requiem

Them old ideas (yeah), are buried here (yeah)

Amen

'Men (amen)
