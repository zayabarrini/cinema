# Everytime 

Notice me

Take my hand

Why are we

Strangers when

Our love is strong?

Why carry on without me?

Every time I try to fly, I fall

Without my wings, I feel so small

I guess I need you, baby

And every time I see you in my dreams

I see your face, it's haunting me

I guess I need you, baby

I make believe

That you are here

It's the only way

I see clear

What have I done?

You seem to move on easy

And every time I try to fly, I fall

Without my wings, I feel so small

I guess I need you, baby

And every time I see you in my dreams

I see your face, you're haunting me

I guess I need you, baby

I may have made it rain

Please forgive me

My weakness caused you pain

And this song's my sorry

Ooh

At night, I pray

That soon your face will fade away

And every time I try to fly, I fall

Without my wings, I feel so small

I guess I need you, baby

And every time I see you in my dreams

I see your face, you're haunting me

I guess I need you, baby

# Sometimes 

You tell me you're in love with me

Like you can't take your pretty eyes away from me

It's not that I don't wanna stay

But every time you come too close, I move away

I wanna believe in everything that you say

'Cause it sounds so good

But if you really want me, move slow

There's things about me you just have to know

Sometimes I run

Sometimes I hide

Sometimes I'm scared of you

But all I really want is to hold you tight

Treat you right

Be with you day and night

Baby, all I need is time

I don't wanna be so shy, uh-oh

Every time that I'm alone, I wonder why

Hope that you will wait for me

You'll see that you're the only one for me

I wanna believe in everything that you say

'Cause it sounds so good

But if you really want me, move slow

There's things about me you just have to know

Sometimes I run (Sometimes)

Sometimes I hide

Be with you day and night

All I really want is to hold you tight

Treat you right

Be with you day and night

If you love me, trust in me

The way that I trust in you

Ah, ooh, yeah

Sometimes I run (Sometimes)

Sometimes I hide

Sometimes I'm scared of you (Ooh, oh)

But all I really want is to hold you tight (Hold you tight)

# Overprotected (The Darkchild Remix) 

I need time

Joy

I need space

Love, I need me

(Four, three, two, one)

Say hello to the girl that I am

You're gonna have to see through my perspective

I need to make mistakes just to learn who I am

And I don't wanna be so damn protected

There must be another way

'Cause I believe in taking chances

But who am I to say what a girl is to do?

God, I need some answers

What am I to do with my life? (You will find it out, don't worry)

How am I supposed to know what's right? (You just gotta do it your way)

I can't help the way I feel

But my life has been so overprotected

I'll tell 'em what I like, what I want, and what I don't

But every time I do, I stand corrected

Things that I've been told, I can't believe what I hear about the world

I realize I'm overprotected

There must be another way

'Cause I believe in taking chances

But who am I to say what a girl is to do?

God, I need some answers

What am I to do with my life? (You will find it out, don't worry)

How am I supposed to know what's right? (You just gotta do it your way)

I can't help the way I feel (Help the way I feel)

But my life has been so overprotected

I need time, love

I need space

I don't need nobody telling me just what I wanna

What I, what, what, what I'm gonna (I need) do about my destiny

I say no, no, nobody's telling me just what I wanna do, do

I'm so fed up with people telling me to be someone else but me

Hey, yeah

What am I to do with my life? (You will find it out, don't worry)

How am I supposed to know what's right? (You just gotta do it your way)

I can't help the way I feel (Feel)

But my life has been so overprotected

I don't need nobody telling me just what I wanna

What I, what, what, what I'm gonna

Do about my destiny

(I say no, no) Nobody's telling me just

What, what, what I wanna do, do

I'm so fed up with people telling me to be

Someone else but me

What am I to do with my life? (You will find it out, don't worry)

How am I supposed to know what's right? (You just gotta do it your way)

I can't help the way I feel (Help the way I feel)

But my life has been so overprotected

# Lucky 

This is a story about a girl named Lucky

Early morning, she wakes up

Knock, knock, knock on the door

It's time for makeup, perfect smile

It's you they're all waiting for

They go, "Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?"

And they say

"She's so lucky, she's a star"

But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking

"If there's nothing missing in my life

Then why do these tears come at night?"

Lost in an image, in a dream

But there's no one there to wake her up

And the world is spinning, and she keeps on winning

But tell me, what happens when it stops?

They go, "Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?"

And they say

"She's so lucky, she's a star"

But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking

"If there's nothing missing in my life

Then why do these tears come at night?"

"Best actress, and the winner is, Lucky!"

"I'm Roger Johnson for Pop News, standing outside the arena waiting for Lucky"

"Oh my God, here she comes!"

Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?

She is so lucky, but why does she cry?

If there is nothing missing in her life

Why do tears come at night?

And they say

"She's so lucky, she's a star"

But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking

"If there's nothing missing in my life

Then why do these tears come at night?"

"She's so lucky, she's a star"

But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking

"If there's nothing missing in my life

Then why do these tears come at night?"

I used to think I had the answers to everything

But now I know

That life doesn't always go my way, yeah

Feels like I'm caught in the middle

That's when I realized

I'm not a girl

Not yet a woman

All I need is time, a moment that is mine

While I'm in between

Somebody pass my guitar

So I can look like a star

And spend this cash like

What you gonna do when the crowd goes, "Ayo"?

Why you standing on the wall?

Music starting everywhere

So why don't you just move along?

Oh, it's so hot, and I need some air

And boy, don't stop 'cause I'm halfway there

Breathe on me (Oh, oh)

Oh baby just, breathe on me

We don't need to touch, just

He is a hustler, he's no good at all

He is a loser, he's a bum, bum, bum, bum

He lies, he bluffs, he's unreliable

He is a sucker with a gun, gun, gun, gun

I know you told me I should stay away

I know you said he's just a dog astray

He's a bad boy with a tainted heart

And even I know this ain't smart

But, mama, I'm in love with a criminal

And this type of love isn't rational, it's physical

Mama, please don't cry, I will be alright

All reason aside, I just can't deny, love the guy

He is a villain by the devil's law

He is a killer just for fun, fun, fun, fun

The man's a snitch and unpredictable

He's got no conscience, he got none, none, none, none

Oh-oh, I know, oh

Should've let go, but no

Mama, please don't cry, I will be alright

All reason aside, I just can't deny, love the guy

And he's got my name

Tattooed on his arm, his lucky charm

So I guess it's okay

He's with me

And I hear people talk (People talk)

Try to make remarks, keep us apart

But I don't even hear

I don't care

'Cause, mama, I'm in love with a criminal

And this type of love isn't rational, it's physical

Mama, please don't cry, I will be alright

All reason aside, I just can't deny, love the guy (I love the guy)

Let's just do it, you and me

You and me

Or three

Or four, on the floor

One, two, three, not only you and me

Got one-eighty degrees, and I'm caught in between

Countin', one, two, three, Peter, Paul, and Mary

Getting down with 3P, everybody loves— (Oh)

Countin' one, two, three, not only you and me

Got one-eighty degrees, and I'm caught in between

Countin', one, two, three, Peter, Paul, and Mary

Getting down with 3P, everybody loves— (Oh)

# Make Me...

Friday

I'm dreaming a mile a minute 'bout somebody

This feeling, I wanna go with it, 'cause there's no way

We're hiding away from this tonight, oh, this tonight

Can tell you want me

No shame in the game, just cut the shit, be honest

Just want you to raise my roof

Something sensational (Sensational, oh, yeah)

And make me ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

And make me ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

No rules

From the bar to the car, let's take it back to my room

Ignite in the heat of the moment, let the sparks fuse

Blowin' up to the ceiling, we burnin' bright when we cut the light

'Cause you're the flame I can't do without

The fire comes in, the sky falls down

There's no way I'm gonna be fighting this tonight, this tonight

Just want you to raise my roof

Something sensational (Sensational, oh, yeah)

My heart's on fire when you're around

Out in Vegas or a little bar

It's really not a difference if it's near or far

Listen, here we are, need you

I've always wanted what was off limits

Staring at you 'til I'm caught in this

Back and forth like this is all tennis

I'm all jealous, you came with someone

But we can tell that there are changes comin'

See, I can tell that you're a dangerous woman

That means you're speakin' my language, come on

Well aware that stealin' you is a felony, yeah, I know

That's why they keep on tellin' me to let go, yeah (Go)

All the way and I'm able

To give you something sensational, so let's go, yeah (Go)

# Touch of My Hand

I'm not ashamed of the things that I dream

I find myself flirting with the verge of obscene

Into the unknown, I will be bold

I'm going to places I can be out of control

And I don't want to explain tonight

All the things I've tried to hide

I shut myself out from the world so I

Can draw the blinds and I'll teach myself to fly

I love myself, it's not a sin

I can't control what's happening

'Cause I just discovered

Imagination's taking over

Another day without a lover

The more I come to understand

The touch of my hand

The small of my back, the arch of my feet

Lately I've been noticing the beautiful me

I'm all in my skin and I'm not gonna wait

I'm into myself in the most precious way

And I don't want to explain tonight

All the things I've tried to hide (To hide)

I shut myself out from the world so I

Can draw the blinds and I'll teach myself to fly

'Cause I just discovered

Imagination's taking over

Another day without a lover

The more I come to understand

The touch of my hand

There's a world undefined

In my body and mind

I won't be left behind

I'm already here

'Cause I just discovered

Imagination's taking over

Another day without a lover

The more I come to understand

The touch of my hand

'Cause I just discovered

Imagination's taking over

Another day without a lover

The more I come to understand

The touch of my hand

Hey, hey, hey, oh, oh (Oh, oh)

Hey, hey, hey, hey, oh, oh (Oh, oh)

# Unusual You

Nothing about you is typical

Nothing about you's predictable

You got me all twisted and confused

It's all new

Up 'til now, I thought I knew love

Nothing to lose and it's damage 'cause

Patterns will fall as quick as I do

But now

Bridges are burning, baby, I'm learning

A new way of thinking of

Love, I can see nothing will be just like it was

Is that because

Baby, you're so unusual?

Didn't anyone tell you you're supposed to

Break my heart? I expect you to

So why haven't you?

Maybe you're not even human 'cause

Only an angel could be so unusual

Sweet surprise I could get used to

Unusual you

(Ah, ah)

(Ah, ah)

Been so many things when I was someone else

Boxer in the ring, tryna defend myself

And the private eye to see what's going on

That's long gone

When I'm with you, I can just be myself

You're always where you say you will be

Shocking 'cause I never knew love like this

Could exist

Tables are turning, my heart is soaring

You'll never let me down

Answered my call, here after all

Never met anyone like you

Baby, you're so unusual

Didn't anyone tell you you're supposed to

Break my heart? I expect you to

So why haven't you?

Maybe you're not even human 'cause

Only an angel could be so unusual

Sweet surprise I could get used to

Unusual you

(Ah, ah)

(Ah, ah)

Can't believe that I almost didn't try

When you called my name

Now everything has changed

Baby, you're so unusual

Didn't anyone tell you you're supposed to

Break my heart? I expect you to

So why haven't you?

Maybe you're not even human 'cause

Only an angel could be so unusual

Sweet surprise I could get used to

Unusual you

(Ah, ah)

(Ah, ah)

# Phonography

We're not so different, you and me

And I like my bluetooth, buttons coming loose (Loose)

I need my hands free (Ah, ah)

Then I let my mind roam (Ah, ah)

Better make sure that the line is clean

Keep it confidential, you and me

# Lonely

To think I'm so naive

How dare you play with me?

I gave you heart and soul, yeah

Tell me baby, please

Why you screwing with my head?

I don't think you understand

I won't take your (huh) no more

Don't knock on my door

Not this time, because I recognize

I've heard it all before, and I

I think of all the time that I wasted

Think of all the times that I took you back

Ain't no way I'll be lonely

I don't wanna let you back in

Let's just face it

Better off alone and I won't turn back

You thought that I would be lonely

I don't wanna let you back in

Don't tell me how to feel

Or say that you're for real

My mind's made up, I'm cool without ya

You got no more appeal

Now this girl don't need no man

To say what she can do or what she can't

Now I live for me

Boy, does that make you weep?

Not this time, because I realize

I've heard it all before, and I

I think of all the time that I wasted

Think of all the times that I took you back

Ain't no way I'll be lonely

I don't wanna let you back in

Let's just face it

Better off alone and I won't turn back

You thought that I would be lonely

I don't wanna let you back in

Think of times you made me cry

You had me so confused

I'm tired of trying, I'll leave behind this

What's a girl to do?

I think of all the times you made me sick

I used to think I couldn't handle it

What you think, I'm just another chick?

Messed with Brit, boy, you must have tripped

What were you thinking when you lost my trust?

You had it all, now you're left with nothing

Ooh, baby, now I know you want my touch

And now you're lonely and you still want me

I think of all the time that I wasted

Think of all the times that I took you back

Ain't no way I'll be lonely

I don't wanna let you back in

Let's just face it

Better off alone and I won't turn back

You thought that I would be lonely

I don't wanna let you back in

Think of all the time that I wasted

Think of all the times that I took you back

Ain't no way I'll be lonely

I don't wanna let you back in

Let's just face it

Better off alone and I won't turn back

You thought that I would be lonely

I don't wanna let you back in

I used to be your girlfriend and I know I did it well

Oh yes, you know it's true

You'd call me Cinderella

All you had to do was yell, and I'd be there for you

Here I am, so try to forgive me

I don't believe in fairytales

Here we are with nothing but honesty

I've had enough, I'm not gonna stay

I'm sorry for running away like this

And I'm sorry, I've already made my wish

Aah, but Cinderella's got to go

From time to time, I tried to tell just what was on my mind

You'd tell me, "Not today"

"Come back, do that"

"Where's Cinderella at?"

Was all you had to say

Here I am, so try to forgive me

I don't believe in fairytales

Here we are with nothing but honesty

I've had enough, I'm not gonna stay

I'm sorry for running away like this

And I'm sorry, I've already made my wish

Aah, but Cinderella's got to go

I'm sorry, just trying to live my life

Don't worry, you're gonna be alright

But Cinderella's got to go

I used to say I want you

You cast me in your spell

I did everything you wanted me to

But now I shall break free from all your lies

I won't be blind, you see

My love, it can't be sacrificed

I won't return to thee

I'm so sorry, I've already made up my mind

I won't return to thee

I'm sorry to say, I'm running away now

Don't worry, you will be alright

I'm running away, I've made up my mind now

You're gonna have to let me go

I'm sorry for running away like this

And I'm sorry, I've already made my wish

Aah, but Cinderella's got to go

I'm sorry, just trying to live my life

Don't worry, you're gonna be alright

But Cinderella's got to go

# Let Me Be

You try to read me, you try to figure out

You try to breathe me, but you can't blow me out

You try to feel me, but I'm so out of touch

I won't be falling, you won't have to pick me up

Sorry if I sound confused, I don't feel the way you do

But I won't turn around, but I won't turn around

Think that I might back down, but I won't

Think that I might have doubts, but I don't

No insecurities

Won't you just let me, let me be?

Think that you know me now, but you don't

Think that I, I can't stand on my own

Ain't my philosophy

Won't you just let me, let me be?

Trust in my instincts, trust that I know what's right

These are the reasons that keep you up at night (At night)

Tell me, "Go slow, this is my flow"

'Cause you don't know, know what I know

Let me tell you how it feels

Baby, it's time that you've seen me for real

Sorry if I sound confused, I don't feel the way you do

But I won't turn around (Won't turn around)

But I won't turn around

Think that I might back down, but I won't

Think that I might have doubts, but I don't

No insecurities

Won't you just let me, let me be?

Think that you know me now, but you don't

Think that I, I can't stand on my own

Ain't my philosophy

Won't you just let me, let me be?

Trust that I know, this is my show

Letting you know, gotta go the way I go

Trust that I know, this is my show

Letting you know, gotta go the way I go

Think that I might back down, but I won't

Think that I might have doubts, but I don't

No insecurities

Won't you just let me, let me be?

Think that you know me now, but you don't

Think that I, I can't stand on my own

Ain't my philosophy (It ain't my philosophy, yeah)

Won't you just let me, let me be?

Think that I might back down, but I won't

Think that I might have doubts, but I don't

No insecurities (No insecurities)

Won't you just let me, let me be?

Think that you know me now, but you don't

Think that I, I can't stand on my own (Think I can't stand on my own)

Ain't my philosophy

Won't you just let me, let me be?

# Bombastic Love

I, I'm here to testify

That you're the only one I belong to

I don't know where to start, it turned into an art

Not to show the world that it was you

Who made me realize not to compromise

The fact that you and I should meet

(I know we're gonna get, know we're gonna get, get)

Bombastic love, so fantastic

Where I’m completely yours, and you are mine

And it's gonna be exactly like in a movie

When we fall in love for the first time

Don't know why I feel so insecure

I never understood what it's good for

I've gotta make sure that weakness won't stop me again

I can't sit and wait anymore

You made me realize not to compromise

The fact that you and I should meet

(I know we're gonna get, know we're gonna get, get)

Bombastic love, so fantastic

Where I’m completely yours, and you are mine

And it's gonna be exactly like in a movie

When we fall in love for the first time

It's gonna be bombastic love

Everything is gonna be alright

When I'm yours and you are mine

It's gonna be a fantastic love

When I wake up, everything is still the same

And you don't even know my name

I know it's gonna be

Bombastic love, so fantastic

Where I’m completely yours, and you are mine

And it's gonna be exactly like in a movie

When we fall in love for the first time

(I know we're gonna get, know we're gonna get, get)

Bombastic love, so fantastic (Bombastic love, ooh yeah)

Where I’m completely yours, and you are mine (And you are mine)

And it's gonna be exactly like in a movie (Exactly like in the movies, baby)

When we fall in love for the first time

# That’s Where You Take Me

Oh baby, oh baby

Oh baby, oh baby

The love that all believe, I never found inside of me

Built these walls up so high, needed my room to breathe

Oh baby, oh baby, you tear them down

Can't believe you've changed my mind

Oh baby, oh baby, I saw your smile

Stay with me a while

All things fall into place

My heart, it feels so safe

You are my melody

That's where you take me

With you, I get so high

Lost in the crystal sky

You are this melody

That's where you take me

I never fell before, how did you find my door?

The key to my soul, to you forever more

Oh baby, oh baby, you make me rise

And never did I once think twice

Oh baby, oh baby, you make me smile

Stay with me a while, oh

All things fall in to place

My heart, it feels so safe

You are my melody

That's where you take me (That's where you take me)

With you, I get so high (I get so high)

Lost in the crystal sky (Crystal sky)

You are this melody

That's where you take me

Afraid to let it all inside

Now I wanna hear you'll stay with me a while

Stay with me a while

La-la-la-la-la-la (La-la-la)

La-la-la-la-la-la (La-la-la)

La-la-la-la-la-la (La-la-la)

That's where you take me

All things fall in to place

My heart, it feels so safe

You are my melody (Oh, baby)

That's where you take me (Where you, where you take me)

With you, I get so high

Lost in the crystal sky

You are this melody (Oh, baby)

That's where you take me

All things fall in to place

My heart, it feels so safe

You are my melody

That's where you take me

With you, I get so high

Lost in the crystal sky

# When I Found You

I believe we all have one true love

Somewhere in this world, I do

When it seemed all my dreams were falling through

That's when I found you

I believe for every heart that whispers in the dark

There's a ray of light somewhere shining through

It was sink or swim when the tide came in

I found myself when I found you

I found the closest thing to heaven

Yes, in you, I found the deepest love I knew

Ooh-ooh, oh, I believe, yes, it's true

I found myself when I found you

Ooh, yeah

I believe (I believe) for every door (Every door)

That's closing

For every heartbreak there's hope for something new

From the ashes rise a glimpse of paradise

It still flickered in your eyes

When I found you

I found the closest thing to heaven

Yes, in you, I found the deepest love I knew

Ooh-ooh, oh, I believe, yes, it's true

I found myself when I found you

Ooh, yeah

How life unfolds, no one knows

I thought love was just a tingling of the skin

I felt so alone, all alone

More than you could ever know

You show deeper love, sweeter love, when I found you

I found the closest thing to Heaven

I found the deepest love I knew

When I found you

I found the closest thing to heaven

Yes, in you, I found the deepest love I knew

Ooh-ooh, oh, I believe, yes, it's true

I found myself when I found you

Ooh, yeah

# I Run Away

You took your love away too fast

Left no chance to say, "Look back"

And now I know the truth, it makes it easier

Maybe when time goes by, I’ll understand

Let’s pretend that I’ve moved on

And I'll tell myself that life goes on without you

Open my eyes, look deep inside

I run away, I run away, I run away

You threw it all away

So blind (So blind)

You pushed me far from you in your life

Now I know the tears won’t lead to loneliness

Maybe when time goes by, I’ll understand

Let’s pretend that I’ve moved on

And I'll tell myself that life goes on without you

Open my eyes, look deep inside

I run away, I run away, I run away, I run away

Let’s pretend that I’ve moved on

And I'll tell myself that life goes on without you

Open my eyes, look deep inside

I run away, I run away, I run away

Let’s pretend that I’ve moved on

And I'll tell myself that life goes on without you

Open my eyes, look deep inside

I run away, I run away

Let's pretend that I've moved on

And I'll tell myself that life goes on without you

# What It’s Like to Be Me

Do you know what it's like?

Come on, come on

Baby, tell me, do I

Look like the kinda girl that you wanna take home?

Wanna make me your own?

Do you even know what I like?

Just what I'm living for, what I adore?

Baby, take the time to realize

I'm not the kind to sacrifice the way I am

So, if you wanna be my man, baby

Walk a mile in my shoes

Do me right or I'm through

Can't you see that if you want to stay around (I'm telling you)

You've got to figure me out? Boy

Take your time or you lose

This is my game, my rules

And I can see, obviously

Baby, you don't know what it’s like to be me

Do you know what it’s like?

Do you know what it’s like?

Don't you get it twisted, boy, I want you too

But you got my heart to win before I let you in

And this deceives you, baby, I'm not the average lady

I need someone to love

Baby, take the time to realize

I'm not the kind to sacrifice the way I am

So, if you wanna be my man, baby

Walk a mile in my shoes

Then you can show me that you love for me is true

And I'll give you everything that a girl could give

Don't you want to be my man? (Oh)

Walk a mile in my shoes

Do me right, or I'm through

Can't you see that if you want to stay around (I'm telling you)

You've got to figure me out? (You, you've got to figure me out)

Take your time or you lose (Yeah, yeah)

This is my game, my rules (Yeah, oh)

And I can see, obviously

Baby, you don't know what it’s like to be me

# Before the Goodbye

Laying here in your arms, and you hold me tight, tight

Trying not to watch the clock tick, ticking as the time goes by

And I know that you best be on your way

But I'm wishing I could make you stay, stay with me for a while

Though you're near, still I wanna make it clear

Love, I will always be around

You're leaving, I'm waiting, forgive me

I'm always missing you before the goodbye

I feel it already, forgive me

I'm always missing you before the goodbye

Kinda hard for me to let you know

Still don't let my feelings show how much I will miss in you

All the little things that make me weak

Your eyes and the way you speak, without you, baby, I'm not me

Though you're near, still I wanna make it clear

Love, I will always be around

You're leaving, I'm waiting, forgive me

I'm always missing you before the goodbye

I feel it already, forgive me

I'm always missing you before the goodbye

You're leaving, I'm waiting, forgive me

I'm always missing you before the goodbye

I feel it already, forgive me

I'm always missing you before the goodbye

You're leaving, I'm waiting, forgive me

I'm always missing you before the goodbye

I feel it already, forgive me

I'm always missing you before the goodbye

You're leaving, I'm waiting, forgive me

I'm always missing you before the goodbye
