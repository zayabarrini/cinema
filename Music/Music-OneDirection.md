# Up all night

## What Makes You Beautiful 

You're insecure, don't know what for

You're turnin' heads when you walk through the door

Don't need makeup to cover up (Huh)

Bein' the way that you are is enough

Everyone else in the room can see it

Everyone else but you

Baby, you light up my world like nobody else

The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed

But when you smile at the ground, it ain't hard to tell

You don't know, oh-oh, you don't know you're beautiful

If only you saw what I can see

You'll understand why I want you so desperately

Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe

You don't know, oh-oh, you don't know you're beautiful, oh-oh

That's what makes you beautiful

So c-come on, you got it wrong

To prove I'm right, I put it in a song

I don't know why you're being shy

And turn away when I look into your eyes

Everyone else in the room can see it

Everyone else but you

Baby, you light up my world like nobody else ('Body else)

The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed

But when you smile at the ground, it ain't hard to tell

You don't know, oh-oh, you don't know you're beautiful (Oh)

If only you saw what I can see

You'll understand why I want you so desperately

Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe

You don't know, oh-oh, you don't know you're beautiful, oh-oh

That's what makes you beautiful

Na, na-na-na, na-na-na, na, na

Na, na-na-na, na-na

Na, na-na-na, na-na-na, na, na

Na, na-na-na, na-na

Baby, you light up my world like nobody else

The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed

But when you smile at the ground, it ain't hard to tell

(You don't know, oh-oh) You don't know you're beautiful

Baby, you light up my world like nobody else (Light up my world like nobody else)

The way that you flip your hair (C'mon) gets me overwhelmed

But when you smile at the ground (Smile at the ground), it ain't hard to tell

You don't know, oh-oh, you don't know you're beautiful (Oh, woah)

If only you saw what I can see

You'll understand why I want you so desperately (Desperately)

Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe

You don't know (Don't know), oh-oh, you don't know you're beautiful, oh-oh

You don't know you're beautiful, oh-oh

That's what makes you beautiful

## Gotta Be You 

Girl, I see it in your eyes, you're disappointed

'Cause I'm the foolish one that you anointed with your heart

I tore it apart

And girl, what a mess I made upon your innocence

And no woman in the world deserves this

But here I am, asking you for one more chance

Can we fall one more time?

Stop the tape and rewind

Oh, and if you walk away, I know I'll fade

'Cause there is nobody else

It's gotta be you, only you

It's got to be you, oh, only you

Hey

Now, girl, I hear it in your voice and how it trembles

When you speak to me, I don't resemble who I was

You've almost had enough

And your actions speak louder than words

And you're about to break from all you've heard

But don't be scared, I ain't goin' nowhere

I'll be here, by your side

No more fears, no more cryin'

But if you walk away, I know I'll fade

'Cause there is nobody else

It's gotta be you, only you

It's got to be you, oh, only you

Oh, girl, can we try one more, one more time?

One more, one more, can we try?

One more, one more time, I'll make it better

(One more, one more, can we try?

One more, one more, can we try?)

Can we try one more time and make it all better?

'Cause it's gotta be you

It's gotta be you

Oh, only you, only you

It's gotta be you, only you

It's got to be you, oh, only you

## One Thing 

I've tried playin' it cool

But when I'm lookin' at you

I can't ever be brave

'Cause you make my heart race

Shot me out of the sky

You're my kryptonite

You keep makin' me weak

Yeah, frozen and can't breathe

Something's gotta give now

'Cause I'm dyin' just to make you see

That I need you here with me now

'Cause you've got that one thing

So get out, get out, get out of my head

And fall into my arms instead

I don't, I don't, don't know what it is

But I need that one thing

And you've got that one thing

Now I'm climbing the walls

But you don't notice at all

That I'm goin' out of my mind

All day and all night

Something's gotta give now

'Cause I'm dyin' just to know your name

And I need you here with me now

'Cause you've got that one thing

So get out, get out, get out of my head

And fall into my arms instead

I don't, I don't, don't know what it is

But I need that one thing

So get out, get out, get out of my mind

And come on, come into my life

I don't, I don't, don't know what it is

But I need that one thing

And you've got that one thing

(Woah, woah, woah)

You've got that one thing

Get out, get out, get out of my head

And fall into my arms instead

So get out, get out, get out of my head (Get out, get out, get out of my head, yeah)

And fall into my arms instead (Instead)

I don't, I don't, don't know what it is

But I need that one thing (I need that one thing)

So get out, get out, get out of my mind (Out of my mind)

And come on, come into my life

I don't, I don't, don't know what it is

But I need that one thing

And you've got that one thing

## More Than This 

Ooh

I'm broken, do you hear me?

I'm blinded, 'cause you are everything I see

I'm dancing alone, I'm praying

That your heart will just turn around

And as I walk up to your door

My head turns to face the floor

'Cause I can't look you in the eyes and say

When he opens his arms and holds you close tonight

It just won't feel right

'Cause I can love you more than this, yeah

When he lays you down, I might just die inside

It just don't feel right

'Cause I can love you more than this

Can love you more than this

If I'm louder, would you see me?

Would you lay down in my arms and rescue me?

'Cause we are the same, you save me

But when you leave, it's gone again

And then I see you on the street

In his arms, I get weak

My body fails, I'm on my knees, praying

When he opens his arms and holds you close tonight

It just won't feel right

'Cause I can love you more than this, yeah

When he lays you down, I might just die inside

It just don't feel right

'Cause I can love you more than this

Yeah

I've never had the words to say

But now I'm asking you to stay

For a little while inside my arms (Ooh)

And as you close your eyes tonight (Ooh)

I pray that you will see the light (Ooh)

That's shining from the stars above

And I say

When he opens his arms and holds you close tonight

It just won't feel right

'Cause I can love you more than this, yeah

('Cause I can love you more than this, yeah)

When he lays you down, I might just die inside

It just don't feel right

'Cause I can love you more than this, yeah

When he opens his arms and holds you close tonight (Holds you close tonight)

It just won't feel right

'Cause I can love you more than this (Yeah), yeah

When he lays you down, I might just die inside (I'm broken)

It just don't feel right

'Cause I can love you more than this

Can love you more than this

## Up All Night 

It feels like we've been living in fast forward

Another moment passing by (Up, up, up all night)

The party's ending, but it's now or never

Nobody's going home tonight (Up, up, up all night)

Katy Perry's on replay, she's on replay

DJ got the floor to shake, the floor to shake

People going all the way, yeah, all the way

I'm still wide awake

I wanna stay

Up all night and jump around until we see the sun

I wanna stay up all night and find a girl and tell her she's the one

Hold on to the feeling and don't let it go

'Cause we got the floor now, get out of control

I wanna stay up all night and do it all with you

Up, up, up all night like this, all night (Hey)

Up all night like this, all night (Hey)

Up all night

Don't even care about the table breaking

We only wanna have a laugh (Up, up, up all night)

I'm only thinking 'bout this girl I'm seeing

I hope she'll wanna kiss me back (Up, up, up all night)

Katy Perry's on replay, she's on replay

DJ got the floor to shake, the floor to shake

People going all the way, yeah, all the way

I'm still wide awake

I wanna stay

Up all night and jump around until we see the sun

I wanna stay up all night and find a girl and tell her she's the one

Hold on to the feeling and don't let it go

'Cause we got the floor now, get out of control

I wanna stay up all night and do it all with you

Up, up, up all night like this, all night (Hey)

Up all night like this, all night (Hey)

Up all night, up all night

We're gonna wanna stay up all night (Night)

I wanna stay

Up all night and jump around until we see the sun

I wanna stay up all night and find a girl and tell her she's the one (She's the one)

Hold on to the feeling and don't let it go

(Up all night, up all night)

'Cause we got the floor now, get out of control

I wanna stay up all night and do it all with you (Do it all with you, with you)

Up, up, up all night like this, all night (Hey)

Up all night like this, all night (Hey; Up all night)

Up all night

## I Wish 

Na-na-na-na-na

Na-na-na-na-na

He takes your hand, I die a little

I watch your eyes and I'm in riddles

Why can't you look at me like that? (Na-na-na-na-na)

When you walk by, I try to say it

But then I freeze and never do it

My tongue gets tied, the words get trapped

I hear the beat of my heart getting louder

Whenever I'm near you

But I see you, with him, slow dancin'

Tearing me apart 'cause you don't see

Whenever you kiss him, I'm breakin'

Oh, how I wish that was me

Na-na-na-na-na

Na-na-na-na-na

He looks at you the way that I would

Does all the things I know that I could

If only time could just turn back

'Cause I got three little words

That I've always been dying to tell you

But I see you, with him, slow dancin'

Tearing me apart 'cause you don't see

Whenever you kiss him, I'm breakin'

Oh, how I wish that was me

With my hands on your waist

While we dance in the moonlight

I wish it was me that you'll call later on

'Cause you wanna say goodnight

'Cause I see you, with him, slow dancing

Tearing me apart 'cause you don't see

But I see you, with him, slow dancin'

Tearing me apart 'cause you don't see

Whenever you kiss him, I'm breakin'

Oh, how I wish, oh, how I wish

Oh, how I wish that was me

Oh, how I wish that was me

## Tell Me a Lie 

Can't ever get it right

No matter how hard I try, and I've tried

Well, I put up a good fight

But your words cut like knives and I'm tired

As you break my heart again this time

Tell me I'm a screwed up mess

That I never listen, listen

Tell me you don't want my kiss

That you need your distance, distance

Tell me anything, but don't you say

He's what you're missing, baby

If he's the reason that you're leaving me tonight

Spare me what you think and tell me a lie

Well, you're the charming type

That little twinkle in your eye gets me every time

And, well, there must've been a time

I was the reason for that smile, so keep in mind

As you take what's left of you and I

Tell me I'm a screwed up mess

That I never listen, listen

Tell me you don't want my kiss

That you need your distance, distance

Tell me anything, but don't you say

He's what you're missing, baby

If he's the reason that you're leaving me tonight

Spare me what you think and tell me a lie

Tell me a lie

Tell me a lie

Tell me a lie

Tell me I'm a screwed up mess

That I never listen, listen (Listen)

Tell me you don't want my kiss

That you need your distance, distance

Tell me anything, but don't you say

He's what you're missing, baby

If he's the reason that you're leaving me tonight (Me tonight)

Spare me what you think and tell me a lie

Tell me a lie

Tell me a lie

Tell me a lie

Tell me a lie

## Taken 

Now that you can't have me

You suddenly want me

Now that I'm with somebody else

You tell me you love me

I slept on your doorstep

Beggin' for one chance

Now that I finally moved on

You say that you missed me all along

Who do you think you are?

Who do you think I am?

You only love to see me breakin'

You only want me 'cause I'm taken

You don't really want my heart

No, you just like to know you can

Still be the one who gets it breakin'

You only want me when I'm taken

You're messin' with my head

Girl, that's what you do best

Sayin' there's nothing you won't do

To get me to say "Yes"

You're impossible to resist

But I wouldn't bet your heart on it

It's like I'm finally awake

And you're just a beautiful mistake

Who do you think you are?

Who do you think I am?

You only love to see me breakin'

You only want me 'cause I'm taken

You don't really want my heart

No, you just like to know you can

Still be the one who gets it breakin'

You only want me when I'm taken

Thank you for showing me who you are underneath, no

Thank you, I don't need another heartless misery

You think I'm doing this to make you jealous

And I know that you hate to hear this

But this is not about you anymore

Who do you think you are?

Who do you think I am?

You only love to see me breakin'

You only want me 'cause I'm taken

You don't really want my heart

No, you just like to know you can (No, you don't, no, you don't)

Still be the one who gets it breakin' (Breakin')

You only want me when I'm taken

Now that you can't have me

You suddenly want me

## I Want 

Give you this, give you that

Blow a kiss, take it back

If I look inside your brain

I would find lots of things

Clothes, shoes, diamond rings

Stuff that's driving me insane

You could be preoccupied

Different date every night

You just got to say the word

But you're not into them at all

You just want materials

I should know because I've heard the girls say

I want, I want, I want, but that's crazy

I want, I want, I want, and that's not me

I want, I want, I want to be loved by you

You've got everythin' you need

But you want accessories

Got to hold it in your hand

If I changed the world for you

I bet you wouldn't have a clue

Don't you know that I can't stand when girls say

I want, I want, I want, but that's crazy

I want, I want, I want, and that's not me

I want, I want, I want to be loved by you

Oh, and all the girls say

I want, I want, I want, but that's crazy

I want, I want, I want, and that's not me

I want, I want, I want to be loved by you

Be loved by you, I wanna

I'll stay true, I wanna

If you knew what you put me through

Would you want, you want, you want me to love you too?

I want, I want, I want, but that's crazy

I want, I want, I want, but that's not me

I want, I want, I wanna be loved by you

(Oh, and all the girls say)

I want, I want, I want, but that's crazy

I want, I want, I want, and that's not me

I want, I want, I want to be loved by you

I want, I want, I want and all the girls say

I want, I want, I want, *and that's crazy*

I want, I want, I want to be loved by you

## Everything About You 

You know I've always got your back, girl

So let me be the one you come running to, running to, ru-ru-runnin'

I see it's just a matter of fact, girl, you just call my name

I'll be coming through, coming through, I'll keep comin'

On the other side of the world, it don't matter

I'll be there in two, I'll be there in two, I'll be there in two

I still feel it every time, it's just something that you do

Now ask me why I want to

It's everything about you, you, you

Everything that you do, do, do

From the way that we touch, baby

To the way that you kiss on me

It's everything about you, you, you (It's everything about you)

The way you make it feel new, new, new

Like every party is just us two

And there's nothing I could point to

It's everything about you, you, you (Everything about you)

It's everything about you, you, you (Everything about you)

It's everything that you do, do, do (Everything about you)

It's everything about you

Yes, I like the way you smile with your eyes

Other guys see it, but don't realise that it's my-my lovin'

There's something about your laugh that it makes me want to have to

There's nothing funny so we laugh at no-no-nothing

Every minute's like the last, so let's just take it real slow

Forget about the clock that's tick-tick-tickin'

I still feel it every time, it's just something that you do

Now ask me why I want to

It's everything about you, you, you

Everything that you do, do, do

From the way that we touch, baby

To the way that you kiss on me (Kiss on me)

It's everything about you, you, you (It's everything about you)

The way you make it feel, new, new, new

Like every party is just us two

And there's nothing I could point to

It's everything about you, you, you (Everything about you)

It's everything about you, you, you (Everything about you)

It's everything that you do, do, do (Everything about you)

It's everything about you

And you have always been the only one I wanted

And I wanted you to know, without you, I can't face it

All we wanna have is fun, but they say that we're too young

Let them say what they want

It's everything about you, you, you

Everything that you do, do, do

From the way that we touch, baby (The way that we touch, baby)

To the way that you kiss on me

It's everything about you, you, you (It's everything about you)

Everything that you do, do, do

Like every party is just us two

And there's nothing I could point to

It's everything about you, you, you (Everything about you)

It's everything about you, you, you (Everything about you)

It's everything that you do, do, do (Everything about you)

It's everything about you

## Same Mistakes 

Circles, we're going in circles, dizzy's all it makes us

We know where it takes us, we've been before

Closer, maybe looking closer, there's more to discover

Find out what went wrong without blamin' each other

Think that we got more time

When we're falling behind

Gotta make up our minds

Or else we'll play, play, play all the same old games

And we wait, wait, wait for the end to change

And we take, take, take it for granted that we'll be the same

But we're making all the same mistakes

Wake up, we both need to wake up

Maybe if we face up to this, we can make it through this

Closer, maybe we'll be closer, stronger than we were before, yeah

Make this something more, yeah

Think that we got more time

When we're falling behind

Gotta make up our minds

Or else we'll play, play, play all the same old games

And we wait, wait, wait for the end to change

And we take, take, take it for granted that we'll be the same

But we're making all the same mistakes

Yeah, yeah, that's what crazy is

When it's broke and you say there's nothing to fix

And you pray, pray, pray that everything will be okay

While you're making all the same mistakes

Don't look back

But if we don't look back

We're only learning then

How to make all the same mis—

Same mistakes again

So we play, play, play all the same old games (The same mistakes)

And we wait, wait, wait for the end to change (When nothing's gonna change)

And we take, take, take it for granted that we'll be the same (But nothing's gonna be the same)

But we're making all the same mistakes

Yeah, yeah, that's what crazy is (Crazy is)

When it's broke and you say there's nothing to fix (There's nothing to fix)

And you pray, pray, pray that everything will be okay (Oh, oh; That everything will be okay)

While you're making all the same mistakes

## Save You Tonight

Baby, be mine tonight, mine tonight

And if you, you want me too, let's make a move

Yeah, so tell me, girl, if every time we

## Little Things 

Your hand fits in mine like it's made just for me

But bear this in mind, it was meant to be

And I'm joinin' up the dots with the freckles on your cheeks

And it all makes sense to me

I know you've never loved the crinkles by your eyes when you smile

You've never loved your stomach or your thighs

The dimples in your back at the bottom of your spine

But I'll love them endlessly

I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth

But if I do, it's you, oh, it's you, they add up to

I'm in love with you and all these little things

You can't go to bed without a cup of tea

And maybe that's the reason that you talk in your sleep

And all those conversations are the secrets that I keep

Though it makes no sense to me

I know you've never loved the sound of your voice on tape

You never want to know how much you weigh

You still have to squeeze into your jeans

But you're perfect to me

I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth

But if it's true, it's you, it's you, they add up to

I'm in love with you and all these little things

You'll never love yourself half as much as I love you

And you'll never treat yourself right, darling, but I want you to

If I let you know, I'm here for you

Maybe you'll love yourself like I love you, oh

And I've just let these little things slip out of my mouth

'Cause it's you, oh, it's you, it's you, they add up to

And I'm in love with you and all these little things

I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth

But if it's true, it's you, it's you, they add up to

I'm in love with you and all your little things

## C'mon, C'mon 

C'mon, c'mon (Ooh)

The one that I came with

She had to go

But you look amazing

Standing alone

So, c'mon, c'mon

Move a little closer now

C'mon, c'mon

Ain't no way you're walking out

C'mon, c'mon

Show me what you're all about

Yeah, I've been watching you all night

There's something in your eyes

Saying, "C'mon, c'mon, and dance with me, baby"

Yeah, the music is so loud, I wanna be yours now

So c'mon, c'mon, and dance with me, baby

The one that I came with

Didn't know how to move (Oh-oh-oh-oh)

The way that you let your hair down

I can tell that you do

So, c'mon, c'mon

Move a little closer now

C'mon, c'mon

Ain't no way you're walking out

C'mon, c'mon

Show me what you're all about

Yeah, I've been watching you all night

Saying, "C'mon, c'mon, and dance with me, baby"

Yeah, the music is so loud, I wanna be yours now

So c'mon, c'mon, and dance with me, baby

And every step I take, I feel it more and more

She's calling out, she's a lucky girl

My heart is racing, she's turning around

I reach for her hand and I say

Hey, I've been watching you all night

There's something in your eyes

Saying, "C'mon, c'mon, and dance with me, baby"

Yeah, the music is so loud, I wanna be yours now

So c'mon, c'mon, and dance with me, baby

Yeah, yeah

C'mon, c'mon (Ooh)

C'mon, c'mon (Ooh)

C'mon, c'mon, and dance with me, baby

## Heart Attack 

Baby, you got me sick, I don't know what I did

Need to take a break and figure it out, yeah

Got your voice in my head saying, "Let's just be friends"

Can't believe the words came outta your mouth, yeah

I'm tryna be okay, I'm tryna be alright

But seeing you with him just don't feel right

And I'm, like, (Ow!)

Never thought it'd hurt so bad, gettin' over you, ooh

And (Ow!)

You're giving me a heart attack looking like you do, ooh

'Cause you're all I ever wanted, thought you would be the one

It's (Ow!) giving me a heart attack

Gettin' over you, ooh, ooh, ooh

Never thought it'd hurt so bad, gettin' over you, ooh

## Rock Me 

Do you remember summer '09?

Wanna go back there every night

Just can't lie, was the best time of my life

Lyin' on the beach as the sun blew out

Playing this guitar by the fire too loud

Oh, my, my, they could never shut us down

I used to think that I was better alone

Why did I ever wanna let you go?

Under the moonlight as we stared at the sea

The words you whispered, I will always believe

I want you to rock me, rock me, rock me, yeah

I want you to rock me, rock me, rock me, yeah

I want you to hit the pedal, heavy metal, show me you care

I want you to rock me, rock me, rock me, yeah

Yeah, we were together, summer '09

Wanna roll back like pressing rewind

You were mine and we never said goodbye (Ay, ay)

I used to think that I was better alone (Was better alone)

Why did I ever wanna let you go? (Let you go)

Under the moonlight as we stared at the sea (Stared at the sea)

The words you whispered I will always believe

I want you to rock me, rock me, rock me, yeah

I want you to rock me, rock me, rock me, yeah

I want you to hit the pedal, heavy metal, show me you care

I want you to rock me, rock me, rock me, yeah (Rock me, yeah)

R-O-C-K me again, R-O-C-K me again

R-O-C-K me a-again, yeah, I want you to

R-O-C-K me again, R-O-C-K me again

R-O-C-K me a-again, yeah

I want you to hit the pedal, heavy metal, show me you care (Show me you care)

I want you to rock me (Me, rock me), rock me, rock me, yeah

## Change My Mind 

The end of the night, we should say goodbye

But we carry on while everyone's gone

Never felt like this before, are we friends or are we more?

As I'm walking towards the door, I'm not sure

But, baby, if you say you want me to stay, I'll change my mind

'Cause I don't wanna know I'm walkin' away if you'll be mine

Won't go, won't go

So, baby, if you say you want me to stay, stay for the night

I'll change my mind

Lean in when you laugh, we take photographs

There's no music on, but we dance along

Never felt like this before, are we friends or are we more?

As I'm walking towards the door, I'm not sure

But, baby, if you say you want me to stay, I'll change my mind

'Cause I don't wanna know I'm walkin' away if you'll be mine

Won't go, won't go

So, baby, if you say you want me to stay, stay for the night

I'll change my mind

I'll change my mind

But, baby, if you say you want me to stay, I'll change my mind

But, baby, if you say you want me to stay, I'll change my mind

'Cause I don't wanna know I'm walkin' away if you'll be mine

Won't go, won't go

So, baby, if you say you want me to stay, stay for the night

I'll change my mind

## I Would 

Lately, I found myself thinking

Been dreaming about you a lot

And up in my head, I'm your boyfriend

But that's one thing you've already got

He drives to school every morning

While I walk alone in the rain

He'd kill me without any warning

If he took a look in my brain

Would he say he's in L-O-V-E?

Well, if it was me, then I would, I would

Would he hold you when you're feeling low?

Baby, you should know that I would, I would

Would he say he's in L-O-V-E?

Well, if it was me, then I would, I would

Would he hold you when you're feeling low?

Baby, you should know that I would

Back in my head, we were kissing

I thought things were going alright (Alright, alright, alright)

With a sign on my back saying "Kick me"

Reality ruined my life (Go Tommo, go!)

Feels like I'm constantly playing

A game that I'm destined to lose

'Cause I can't compete with your boyfriend

He's got twenty-seven tattoos

Would he say he's in L-O-V-E?

Well, if it was me, then I would, I would

Would he hold you when you're feeling low?

Baby, you should know that I would, I would

Would he say he's in L-O-V-E?

Well, if it was me, then I would, I would

Would he hold you when you're feeling low?

Baby, you should know that I would

I would, I would

Would he please you?

Would he kiss you?

Would he treat you like I would? (I would)

Would he touch you?

Would he need you?

Would he love you like I would?

Would he say he's in L-O-V-E?

Well, if it was me, then I would

Would he hold you when you're feeling low?

Baby, you should know that I would

Would he please you? (Would he please you?)

Would he kiss you? (Would he kiss you?)

Would he treat you like I would? (Like I would)

Would he touch you? (Would he touch you?)

Would he need you? (Would he need you?)

Would he love you like I would? (Like I would)

Would he say he's in L-O-V-E?

Well, if it was me then I would, I would (Like I would)

Would he hold you when you're feeling low?

Baby, you should know that I would

I would (Yeah), I would (Yeah)

## Over Again 

Said I'd never leave her, 'cause her hands fit like my T-shirt

Tongue tied over three words, cursed

Running over thoughts that make my feet hurt

Bodies intertwined with her lips

Now she's feeling so low since she went solo

Hole in the middle of my heart like a Polo

And it's no joke to me

So can we do it all over again?

If you're pretending from the start

Like this, with a tight grip

Then my kiss can mend your broken heart

I might miss everything you said to me

And I could lend you broken parts

That might fit like this

And I will give you all my heart

So we can start it all over again

Can we take the same road? Two days in the same clothes?

And I know just what she'll say if I can make all this pain go

Can we stop this for a minute?

You know, I can tell that your heart isn't in it or with it

And tell me with your mind, body and spirit

I can make your tears fall down like the showers that are British

Whether we're together or apart, we can both remove the masks

And admit we regret it from the start

If you're pretending from the start

Like this, with a tight grip

Then my kiss can mend your broken heart

I might miss everything you said to me

And I could lend you broken parts

That might fit like this

And I will give you all my heart

So we can start it all over again

You'll never know how to make it on your own

And you'll never show weakness for letting go

I guess it's still hard if the seed's sown

But do you really want to be alone?

If you're pretending from the start

Like this, with a tight grip

Then my kiss can mend your broken heart

I might miss everything you said to me

And I could lend you broken parts

That might fit like this

And I will give you all my heart (All my heart)

So we can start it all o—

If you're pretending from the start (The start)

Like this, with a tight grip (Yeah)

Then my kiss can mend your broken heart (Can mend your broken heart, yeah)

I might miss everything you said to me

And I could lend you broken parts

That might fit like this

And I will give you all my heart

So we can start it all over again

## Back For You 

Whenever I close my eyes, I picture you there

I'm lookin' out at the crowd, you're everywhere

I'm watching you from the stage, yeah

Your smile is on every face now

But every time you wake up, you're hearing me say goodbye

Baby, you don't have to worry

I'll be coming back for you

Back for you, back for you, you

Lately, I've been going crazy

So I'm coming back for you

Back for you, back for you, you

I've never been so into somebody before

And every time we both touch, I only want more

So tell me nothing's gonna change, yeah

And you won't ever walk away, yeah

'Cause even though every night you'll know what I'll say, goodbye

Baby, you don't have to worry

I'll be coming back for you

Back for you, back for you, you

Lately, I've been going crazy

So I'm coming back for you

Back for you, back for you, you

Right back for you, oh-woah

Right back for you, right back for you

Lately, I've been going crazy

So I'm coming back

Yeah, I am coming back for you

Baby, you don't have to worry

I'll be coming back for you

Back for you, back for you, for you (For you, woah)

Lately, I've been going crazy (Crazy, yeah)

So I'm coming back for you

Back for you, back for you, you (Yeah)

Right back for you, right back

Right back for you, right back

Right back for you, right back

Right back for you (C'mon)

Lately, I've been going crazy

So I'm coming back for you

Back for you, back for you, you

## They Don’t Know About Us 

People say we shouldn't be together

We're too young to know about forever

But I say, "They don't know

What they talk, talk, talkin' about" (Talk, talk, talkin' about)

'Cause this love is only getting stronger

So I don't wanna wait any longer

I just wanna tell the world that you're mine, girl, oh

They don't know about the things we do

They don't know about the I love you's

But I bet you, if they only knew (They don't know)

They would just be jealous of us

They don't know about the up all nights

They don't know I've waited all my life

Just to find a love that feels this right (They don't know)

Baby, they don't know about, they don't know about us

Just one touch and I was a believer

Every kiss, it gets a little sweeter

It's getting better

Keeps getting better all the time, girl

They don't know about the things we do

They don't know about the I love you's

But I bet you, if they only knew (They don't know)

They would just be jealous of us

They don't know about the up all nights

They don't know I've waited all my life

Just to find a love that feels this right

Baby, they don't know about, they don't know about us

They don't know how special you are

They don't know what you've done to my heart

They can say anything they want

'Cause they don’t know us

They don't know what we do best

That's between me and you, our little secret

But I wanna tell 'em

I wanna tell the world that you're mine, girl

They don't know about the things we do (They don't know about the)

They don't know about the I love you's (I love you's)

But I bet you, if they only knew (If they only knew)

They would just be jealous of us (They would just be jealous of us)

They don't know about the up all nights

They don't know I've waited all my life (They don't know I've waited all my life)

Just to find a love that feels this right (It feels so right)

Baby, they don't know about (They don't know about us)

They don't know about the things we do (They don't know about us)

They don't know about the I love you's (They don't know about us)

But I bet you, if they only knew

They would just be jealous of us (They would just be jealous of us)

They don't know about the up all nights (Up all nights)

They don't know I've waited all my life (All my life)

Just to find a love that feels this right (Right)

Baby, they don't know about, they don't know about us

They don't know about us

## Summer Love 

Yeah

Ooh, ooh

Can't believe you're packing your bags

Trying so hard not to cry

Had the best time, and now it's the worst time

But we have to say goodbye

Don't promise that you're gonna write

Don't promise that you'll call

Just promise that you won't forget we had it all

'Cause you were mine for the summer

Now we know it's nearly over

Feels like snow in September

But I always will remember

You were my summer love

You always will be my summer love

Wish that we could be alone now

If we could find some place to hide

Make the last time just like the first time

Push a button and rewind

Don't say the word that's on your lips

Don't look at me that way

Just promise you'll remember when the sky is grey

'Cause you were mine for the summer

Now we know it's nearly over

Feels like snow in September

But I always will remember

You were my summer love

You always will be my summer love

So, please, don't make this any harder

We can't take this any further

And I know there's nothing that I wanna change, change

'Cause you were mine for the summer

Now we know it's nearly over

Feels like snow in September

But I always will remember (Will remember)

You were my summer love (Summer love)

You always will be my summer love (Summer love)

You always will be my summer love (*Yeah*)

You always will be my summer love

# Midnight Memories (The Ultimate Edition)

## Best Song Ever 

Maybe it's the way she walked (Ow!)

Straight into my heart and stole it

Through the doors and past the guards (Ow!)

Just like she already owned it

I said, "Can you give it back to me?"

She said, "Never in your wildest dreams"

And we danced all night to the best song ever

We knew every line, now I can't remember

How it goes, but I know that I won't forget her

'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever

I think it went, "Oh, oh, oh," I think it went, "Yeah, yeah, yeah"

I think it goes (Woo!)

Said her name was Georgia Rose (Ow!)

And her daddy was a dentist

Said I had a dirty mouth (I got a dirty mouth)

But she kissed me like she meant it

I said, "Can I take you home with me?"

She said, "Never in your wildest dreams"

And we danced all night to the best song ever

We knew every line, now I can't remember (How it goes, but I know)

How it goes, but I know that I won't forget her

'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever

I think it went, "Oh, oh, oh," I think it went, "Yeah, yeah, yeah"

I think it goes (Woo!)

You know, I know, you know I'll remember you

And I know, you know, I know you'll remember me

And you know, I know, you know I'll remember you (Oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)

And I know, you know, I hope you'll remember how we danced (Oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)

How we danced (Oh, oh, oh, one, two, one, two, three, ow!)

How we danced all night to the best song ever (How we danced)

I think it goes (Woo!)

Best song ever

It was the best song ever

It was the best song ever

It was the best song ever

## Story of My Life 

Written in these walls are the stories that I can't explain

I leave my heart open, but it stays right here empty for days

She told me in the mornin' she don't feel the same about us in her bones

It seems to me that when I die, these words will be written on my stone

And I'll be gone, gone tonight (Oh-oh-oh)

The ground beneath my feet is open wide (Oh-oh-oh)

The way that I've been holding on too tight (Oh-oh-oh)

With nothing in between

The story of my life, I take her home

I drive all night to keep her warm

And time is frozen (The story of, the story of)

The story of my life, I give her hope

I spend her love until she's broke inside

The story of my life (The story of, the story of)

Written on these walls are the colors that I can't change

Leave my heart open, but it stays right here in its cage

I know that in the mornin', I'll see us in the light up on the hill

Although I am broken, my heart is untamed still

And I'll be gone, gone tonight (Oh-oh-oh)

The fire beneath my feet is burning bright (Oh-oh-oh)

The way that I've been holding on so tight (Oh-oh-oh)

With nothing in between

The story of my life, I take her home

I drive all night to keep her warm

And time is frozen (The story of, the story of)

The story of my life, I give her hope

I spend her love until she's broke inside

The story of my life (The story of, the story of)

And I've been waiting for this time to come around

But, baby, running after you is like chasin' the clouds

The story of my life, I take her home

I drive all night to keep her warm

And time is frozen

The story of my life, I give her hope (I give her hope)

I spend her love until she's broke inside ('Til she's broke inside)

The story of my life (The story of, the story of)

The story of my life

The story of my life (The story of, the story of)

The story of my life

## Diana 

Diana

The front pages are your pictures, they make you look so small

How could someone not miss you at all? (Oh-oh-oh)

I never would mistreat ya, no, I'm not a criminal

I speak a different language, but I still hear your call

Diana, let me be the one to

Light a fire inside those eyes

You've been lonely, you don't even know me

But I can feel you crying

Diana, let me be the one to

Lift your heart up and save your life

I don't think you even realise

Baby, you'd be saving mine

Oh-oh

Diana

It's only been four months, but you've fallen down so far

How could someone mislead you at all? (Oh-oh-oh)

I wanna reach out for ya, I wanna break these walls

I speak a different language, but I still hear you call

Diana, let me be the one to

Light a fire inside those eyes

You've been lonely, you don't even know me

But I can feel you crying

Diana, let me be the one to

Lift your heart up and save your life

I don't think you even realise

Baby, you'd be saving mine

We all need somethin'

This can't be over now

If I could hold ya

Swear I'd never put you down

Diana, let me be the one to

Light a fire inside those eyes

You've been lonely, you don't even know me

But I can feel you crying

Diana, let me be the one to

Lift your heart up and save your life

I don't think you even realise

Baby, you'd be saving mine

(Oh-oh-oh) Diana

(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh) Diana

Baby, you'd be savin' mine

(Oh-oh-oh) Diana

(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh) Diana

Baby, you'd be savin' mine

## Midnight Memories 

One, two, three, four

Straight off the plane to a new hotel

Just touched down, you could never tell

Ow, big house party with a crowded kitchen

People talk shh, but we don't listen

Tell me that I'm wrong, but I do what I please

Way too many people in the Addison Lee

Now I'm at the age when I know what I need, oh, woah

Midnight memories, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh

Baby, you and me stumblin' in the street

Singing, singing, singing, singing

Midnight memories, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh

Anywhere we go, never say no

Just do it, do it, do it, do it

Five foot somethin' with the skinny jeans

Don't look back, baby, follow me

I don't know where I'm going, but I'm findin' my way

Same old shh, but a different day

Tell me that I'm wrong, but I do what I please

Way too many people in the Addison Lee

Now I'm at the age when I know what I need, oh, woah

Midnight memories, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh

Baby, you and me stumblin' in the street

Singing, singing, singing, singing

Midnight memories, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh

Anywhere we go, never say no

Just do it, do it, do it

You and me and all our friends

I don't care how much we spend

Baby, this is what the night is for

I know nothing's making sense

For tonight, let's just pretend

I don't wanna stop, so give me more, 'ore, ow!

Midnight memories, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh

Baby, you and me (Me) stumblin' in the street (Street)

Singing, singing, singing, singing

Midnight memories, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh

Anywhere we go (Go), never say no (No)

Just do it, do it, do it, do it (Do it, do it, do it)

## You & I 

I figured it out

I figured it out from black and white

Seconds and hours

Maybe they had to take some time

I know how it goes

I know how it goes from wrong and right

Silence and sound

Did they ever hold each other tight like us?

Did they ever fight like us?

You and I

We don't wanna be like them

We can make it till the end

Nothing can come between you and I

Not even the gods above

Can separate the two of us

No, nothing can come between you and I

Oh, you and I

I figured it out

Saw the mistakes of up and down

Meet in the middle

There's always room for common ground

I see what it's like

I see what it's like for day and night

Never together

'Cause they see things in a different light like us

But they never tried like us

You and I

We don't wanna be like them

We can make it till the end

Nothing can come between you and I

Not even the gods above

Can separate the two of us

'Cause you and I

We don't wanna be like them

We can make it till the end

Nothing can come between you and I (Nothing can come between, yeah)

Not even the gods above

Can separate the two of us

No, nothing can come between you and I (You and I)

Oh, you and I (Oh)

You and I

We could make it if we try, you and I

Oh, you and I

You and I

## Don't Forget Where You Belong 

Been a lot of places, I've been all around the world

Seen a lot of faces, never knowing where I was

On the horizon, hmm, but I know, I know, I know, I know

The sun will be rising back home

Living out of cases, and packing up and taking off

Made a lot of changes, but not forgetting who I was

On the horizon, ooh, well, I know, I know, I know, I know

The moon will be rising back home

Don't forget where you belong, home

Don't forget where you belong, home

If you ever feel alone, don't

You were never on your own

And the proof is in this song

I've been away for ages, but I got everything I need

I'm flicking through the pages I've written in my memory

I feel like I'm dreaming, oh, so I know, I know, I know, I know

That I'm never leaving, no, I won't go

Don't forget where you belong, home

Don't forget where you belong, home

If you ever feel alone, don't

You were never on your own

And the proof is in this song

Lights off when they should be on

Even stars in the skies, they're wrong

Short days, when the nights are long

When I think of the things I've done

Don't matter how far I've gone

I'm always free to run home

Don't forget where you belong, home

Don't forget where you belong (Don't forget it), home

If you ever feel alone, don't

You were never on your own

Never, never, never, home

Don't forget where you belong, home

Don't forget where you belong (Don't forget it), home

If you ever feel alone, don't (Yeah)

You were never on your own (You were never)

And the proof is in this song

Home

Don't forget it

Home

If you ever feel alone, don't

You were never on your own (You were never)

And the proof is in this song

Never forget it, this song (Don't forget it)

No I'll never forget it, this song (You were never)

## Strong 

My hands, your hands, tied up like two ships

Drifting, weightless, waves try to break it

I'd do anything to save it

Why is it so hard to save it?

My heart, your heart, sit tight like bookends

Pages between us written with no end

So many words we're not saying

Don't wanna wait till it's gone

You make me strong

I'm sorry if I say I need you

But I don't care, I'm not scared of love

'Cause when I'm not with you, I'm weaker

Is that so wrong? Is it so wrong

That you make me strong?

Think of how much love that's been wasted

People always trying to escape it

Move on to stop their heart breaking

But there's nothing I'm running from

You make me strong

I'm sorry if I say I need you

But I don't care, I'm not scared of love

'Cause when I'm not with you, I'm weaker

Is that so wrong? Is it so wrong?

So, baby, hold on to my heart, oh

Need you to keep me from fallin' apart

I'll always hold on 'cause you make me strong

I'm sorry if I say I need you

But I don't care, I'm not scared of love

'Cause when I'm not with you, I'm weaker

Is that so wrong? Is it so wrong?

I'm sorry if I say I need you

But I don't care, I'm not scared of love

'Cause when I'm not with you, I'm weaker

Is that so wrong? Is it so wrong

That you make me strong?

I'm sorry if I say I need you

But I don't care, I'm not scared of love

'Cause when I'm not with you, I'm weaker

Is that so wrong? Is it so wrong

That you make me strong?

## Happily 

You don't understand, you don't understand (Yeah)

What you do to me when you hold his hand (Hey)

We were meant to be, but a twist of fate (Yeah)

Made it so we had to walk away (Hey)

'Cause we're on fire

We are on fire

We're on fire now

Yeah, we're on fire

We are on fire

We're on fire now

(One, two, three)

I don't care what people say when we're together

You know I wanna be the one

Who'll hold you when you sleep

I just want it to be you and I forever

I know you wanna leave, so c'mon

Baby, be with me so happily

(Hey) It's 4AM and I know that you're with him

(Yeah) I wonder if he knows that I touched your skin

(Hey) And if he feels my traces in your hair

(Yeah) I'm sorry, love, but I don't really care

'Cause we're on fire

We are on fire

We're on fire now

Yeah, we're on fire

We are on fire

We're on fire now

(One, two, three)

I don't care what people say when we're together

You know I wanna be the one

Who'll hold you when you sleep

I just want it to be you and I forever

Baby, be with me so happily

So happily

One, two, three, four

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, we're on fire now

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, we're on fire now (We're on fire)

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, we're on fire now

I don't care what people say when we're together

You know I wanna be the one

Who'll hold you when you sleep

I just want it to be you and I forever (Yeah, yeah)

I know you wanna leave, so c'mon

Baby, be with me so happily

I don't care what people say when we're together

You know I wanna be the one

Who'll hold you when you sleep

I just want it to be you and I forever

I know you wanna leave, so c'mon

Baby, be with me so happily

## Right Now 

Lights go down, and

The night is calling to me, yeah

I hear voices

Singing songs in the street, and I know

That we won't be going home

For so long, for so long, but I know

That I won't be on my own

Yeah, I love this feeling and

Right now I wish you were here with me (Ooh)

'Cause right now, everything is new to me (Ooh)

You know, I can't fight the feeling

And every night I feel it

Right now I wish you were here with me (Ooh)

Late-night spaces

With all our friends, you and me, yeah

Love these faces

Just like how it used to be

And we won't be going home

For so long, for so long, but I know

I won't be on my own

On my own, I'm feeling like

Right now I wish you were here with me (Ooh)

'Cause right now everything is new to me (Ooh)

You know, I can't fight the feeling

And every night I feel it

Right now I wish you were here with me (Ooh)

And I could do this forever (Woah, woah-oh)

And let's go crazy together (Woah, woah-oh)

Lights go down, and

I hear you calling to me, yeah

Right now I wish you were here with me (Ooh)

'Cause right now everything is new to me (Ooh)

You know, I can't fight the feeling

And every night I feel it

Right now I wish you were here with me (Ooh)

## Little Black Dress 

Little black dress just walked into the room

Makin' heads turn, can't stop looking at you

It's so right, it's so right, it's so right, you know

Little black dress, did you come here alone?

It's too late, it's too late, it's too late to go home

## Through the Dark 

You tell me that you're sad and lost your way

You tell me that your tears are here to stay

But I know you were only hidin'

And I just wanna see ya

You tell me that you're hurt and you're in pain

And I can see your head is held in shame

But I just wanna see you smile again

See you smile again

But don't burn out

Even if you scream and shout

It'll come back to you

And I'll be here for you

Oh, I will carry you over

Fire and water for your love

And I will hold you closer

Hope your heart is strong enough

When the night is coming down on ya

We will find a way

Through the dark

I wish that I could take you to the start

I'd never let you fall and break your heart

And if you wanna cry or fall apart

I'll be there to hold ya

You tell me that you're hurt, it's all in vain

But I can see your heart can love again

And I remember you laughin'

So let's just laugh again

But don't burn out

Even if you scream and shout

It'll come back to you

Back to you

Oh, I will carry you over

Fire and water for your love

And I will hold you closer

Hope your heart is strong enough

When the night is coming down on ya

Hope your heart is strong enough

When the night is coming down

We will find a way

Through the dark

## Little White Lies 

If this room was burnin'

I wouldn't even notice

'Cause you've been takin' up my mind

With your little white lies, little white lies

You say it's gettin' late, it's gettin' late

And you don't know if you can stay, if you can stay

But you, you don't tell the truth, no, you, you like playing games

Your hands touching me, they're touching me

And your eyes keep saying things

They're sayin' what we do when it's only me and you

I can't concentrate

That's all I'm thinkin' about, all I keep thinkin' about

Everythin' else just fades away

Back seat of the cab, we're in the cab

My lips getting so attached, they're so attached

Now, you wanna make some rules

Now, cool, then we'll watch them break tonight

I know what you want

And I've been waiting so long

If this room was burnin'

I wouldn't even notice

'Cause you've been takin' up my mind

With your little white lies, little white lies

You say you're a good girl

But I know you would, girl

'Cause you've been telling me all night

With your little white lies, little white lies

Just what we came to do

## Why Don’t We Go There 

I know you want, know you wanna take it slow

Think about all the places we could go

If you give in tonight, just let me set you free

We'll touch the other side, just give me the key

'Cause we got all night and we're going nowhere

Why don't you stay? Why don't we go there?

Let's take a ride out in the cold air

I know the way, why don't you go there with me?

Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

Say the word, say the word, but don't say no

Skydive, you and I with just these clothes

Your secret's safe with me, there's no right time or place

'Cause anyone could see we'd do it anyway

'Cause we got all night, we're going nowhere

Why don't you stay? Why don't we go there?

Let's take a ride out in the cold air

I know the way, why don't you go there with me?

Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

Hey, I don't want you to be the one that got away

I wanna get addicted to you, yeah

You're rushing through my mind, I wanna feel the high

I wanna be addicted, don't say no, just let go

'Cause we got all night and we're going nowhere

Why don't you stay? Why don't we go there?

Let's take a ride (Let's take a ride) out in the cold air

## Does He Know? 

He knows about you in every way

He's memorised every part of your face

Inside and out, baby, head to toe

Yeah, he knows everything there is to know

Your secret tattoo, the way you change moods

The songs that you sing when you're all alone

Your favourite band, the way that you dance

But baby, baby

Does he know you can move it like that? Woah

Does he know you're out and I want you so bad? Oh

Tonight, you're mine, baby

Does he know that you'll never go back? Oh

Does he know?

I catch your eye, then you turn away

But there's no hidin' the smile on your face

Inside and out, baby, head to toe

He's not around and girl, you let me know

Your secret tattoo, the way you change moods

The songs that you sing when you're all alone

He knows how you dance in front of your friends

But baby, baby

Does he know you can move it like that? Woah

Does he know you're out and I want you so bad? Oh

Tonight, you're mine, baby

Does he know that you'll never go back? Oh

Does he know you're out and I want you so bad? Oh

Tonight, you're mine, baby

Does he know that you'll never go back? Oh

Does he know?

## Alive 

My mother told me I should go and get some therapy

I asked the doctor, "Can you find out what is wrong with me?"

I don't know why I wanna be with every girl I meet

I can't control it, yeah, I know it's takin' over me

I'm going crazy, can't contain it

So tell me just what I should do

She said, "Hey, it's alright, does it make you feel alive?

Don't look back, live your life, even if it's only for tonight"

She said, "Hey, it's alright if it makes you feel alive"

Went to a party just after the doctor talked to me

I met a girl, I took her hand up to the balcony

I whispered somethin' in her ear that I just can't repeat

She said, "Okay," but she was worried what her friends would think

She's going crazy, can't contain it

She asked me, "What should I do?" Oh

I said, "Hey, it's alright, does it make you feel alive?

Don't look back, live your life, even if it's only for tonight"

I said, "Hey, it's alright if it makes you feel alive"

We gotta live before we get older

Do what we like, we got nothing to lose

Shake off the weight of the world from your shoulders

Woah, we've got nothing to prove

I said, "Hey, it's alright, does it make you feel alive?

Don't look back, live your life, even if it's only for tonight"

I said, "Hey (Hey!), it's alright, does it make you feel alive?

Don't look back (Hey!), live your life, even if it's only for tonight"

I said, "Hey (Hey!), it's alright if it makes you feel alive"

## Half a Heart 

So your friend's been telling me

You've been sleepin' with my sweater

And that you can't stop missin' me

Bet my friend's been telling you

I'm not doin' much better

Because I'm missin' half of me

And bein' here without you

Is like I'm wakin' up to

Only half a blue sky

Kinda there, but not quite

I'm walking around with just one shoe

I'm half a heart without you

I'm half a man, at best

With half an arrow in my chest

'Cause I miss everything we do

I'm half a heart without you

Forget all we said that night

No, it doesn't even matter

'Cause we both got split in two

If you could spare an hour or so

We'll go for lunch down by the river

We can really talk it through

And bein' here without you

Is like I'm wakin' up to

Only half a blue sky

Well, kinda there, but not quite

I'm walking around with just one shoe

I'm half a heart without you

I'm half a man, at best

With half an arrow in my chest

'Cause I miss everything we do

I'm half a heart without you

I'm half a heart without you

I'm half a heart without you

Though I try to get you out of my head

The truth is, I got lost without you

And since then, I've been wakin' up to

Only half a blue sky (Only half a blue sky)

Kinda there, but not quite

I'm walking around with just one shoe

I'm half a heart without you

I'm half a man, at best (I'm half a man, at best)

With half an arrow in my chest

I miss everything we do

I'm half a heart without you

Without you, without you

Half a heart without you (Without you, without you)

Without you, without you

I'm half a heart without you

## Ready to Run 

Ooh-ooh-ooh

Ooh-ooh-ooh

There's a lightnin' in your eyes, I can't deny

Then there's me inside a sinking boat, runnin' out of time

Without you, I'll never make it out alive

But I know, yes, I know we'll be alright

There's a devil in your smile, it's chasing me

And every time I turn around, it's only gaining speed

There's a moment when you finally realise

There's no way you can change the rolling tide

But I know, yes, I know that I'll be fine

This time, I'm ready to run (Oh-oh)

Escape from the city and follow the Sun

'Cause I wanna be yours, don't you wanna be mine?

I don't wanna get lost in the dark of the night

This time I'm ready to run (Oh-oh)

Wherever you are is the place I belong

'Cause I wanna be free and I wanna be young

I will never look back, now I'm ready to run

Ooh-ooh-ooh

I'm ready to run

Ooh-ooh-ooh

There's a future in my life I can't foresee

Unless, of course, I stay on course and keep you next to me

There will always be the kind that criticize

But I know, yes, I know we'll be alright

This time, I'm ready to run (Oh-oh)

Escape from the city and follow the Sun

'Cause I wanna be yours, don't you wanna be mine?

I don't wanna get lost in the dark of the night

This time I'm ready to run (Oh-oh)

Wherever you are is the place I belong

'Cause I wanna be free and I wanna be young

I will never look back, now I'm ready to run

This time, I'm ready to run (Ready to run)

I'd give everything that I've got for your love

This time, I'm ready to run

Escape from the city and follow the Sun

'Cause I wanna be yours, don't you wanna be mine?

I don't wanna get lost in the dark of the night

This time I'm ready to run (This time I'm ready to run; Oh-oh)

Wherever you are is the place I belong

'Cause I wanna be free and I wanna be young

I will never look back, now I'm ready to run

## Where Do Broken Hearts Go 

Counted all my mistakes and there's only one

Standin' out from the list of the things I've done

All the rest of my crimes don't come close

To the look on your face when I let you go

So, I built you a house from a broken home

Then I wrote you a song with the words you spoke

Yeah, it took me some time, but I figured out

How to fix up a heart that I let down

Now, I'm searchin' every lonely place

Every corner, callin' out your name

Tryna find you, but I just don't know

Where do broken hearts go?

Where do broken hearts go?

Yeah, the taste of your lips on the tip of my tongue

Is at the top of the list of the things I want

Mind is runnin' in circles of you and me

Anyone in-between is the enemy

Shadows come with the pain that you're runnin' from

Love was something you never heard enough

Yeah, it took me some time, but I figured out

How to fix up a heart that I let down

Now, I'm searchin' every lonely place

Every corner, callin' out your name

Tryna find you, but I just don't know

Where do broken hearts go?

Are you sleeping baby by yourself

Or are you giving it to someone else?

Tryna find you, but I just don't know

Where do broken hearts go?

Where do broken hearts go?

Tell me now, tell me now

Tell me where you go when you feel afraid

(Where do broken hearts go?)

Tell me now, tell me now

Tell me, will you ever love me again, love me again?

Now, I'm searchin' every lonely place

Every corner, callin' out your name

Tryna find you, but I just don't know

Where do broken hearts go?

Are you sleeping baby by yourself

Or are you giving it to someone else?

Tryna find you, but I just don't know

Where do broken hearts go?

Tell me where you're hidin' out

Where do broken hearts go?

Come on, baby, 'cause I need you now

Where do broken hearts go?

Tell me, 'cause I'm ten feet down

Where do broken hearts go?

Come on, baby, come and get me out

Come on, baby, come and get me out

Come on, baby, 'cause I need you now

Where do broken hearts go?

Where do broken hearts go?

Where do broken hearts go?

Where do broken hearts go?

## 18

I got a heart and I got a soul

Believe me, I will use them both

We made a start, be it a false one, I know

Baby, I don't want to feel alone

So kiss me where I lay down

My hands pressed to your cheeks

A long way from the playground

I have loved you since we were eighteen

Long before we both thought the same thing

To be loved and to be in love

All I can do is say that these arms were made for holdin' you, oh

I wanna love like you made me feel

When we were eighteen

We took a chance, God knows we've tried

Yet all along, I knew we'd be fine

So pour me a drink, oh, love

And let's split the night wide open

And we'll see everything we can

Living love in slow motion, motion, motion

So kiss me where I lay down (Ooh-ooh)

My hands pressed to your cheeks (Ooh-ooh)

A long way from the playground (Ooh-ooh)

I have loved you since we were eighteen

Long before we both thought the same thing

To be loved and to be in love

And all I can do is say that these arms were made for holdin' you, oh

And I wanna love like you made me feel

When we were eighteen

When we were eighteen

Oh, lord

When we were eighteen

Kiss me where I lay down

My hands pressed to your cheeks

A long way from the playground

I have loved you since we were eighteen

Long before we both thought the same thing

To be loved and to be in love

And all I can do is say that these arms were made for holdin' you, oh

And I wanna love like you made me feel

When we were eighteen (Eighteen)

I wanna love like you made me feel

When we were eighteen (Eighteen, yeah)

I wanna love like you made me feel

When we were eighteen

## Girl Almighty 

Hey, hey

Oh, no, no, no

Her light is as loud as, as many ambulances

As it takes to save a saviour, oh, woah, woah, woah

Now, she floats through the room on a big balloon

Some say she's such a fake, that her love is made up, no, no, no, no

Let's have another toast to the girl almighty

Let's pray we stay young, stay made of lightnin'

Am I the only, only believer?

There, there's something happening here

There's something happening here

The only, only believer

## Fool's Gold 

I'm like a crow on a wire

You're the shinin' distraction that makes me fly home

I'm like a boat on the water

You're the raise on the waves that calm my mind, oh, every time

But I know in my heart

You're not a constant star

And, yeah, I've let you use me from the day that we first met

But I'm not done yet

Falling for your fool's gold

And I knew that you turned it on for everyone you met

But I don't regret

Falling for your fool's gold

I'm the first to admit that I'm reckless

I get lost in your beauty and I can't see two feet in front of me

And I know in my heart

You're just a moving part

And, yeah, I've let you use me from the day that we first met

But I'm not done yet

Falling for your fool's gold

And I knew that you turned it on for everyone you met

But I don't regret

Falling for your fool's gold

Oh

Yeah, I know your love's not real

That's not the way it feels

That's not the way you feel

And, yes, I've let you use me from the day that we first met

But I'm not done yet

Falling for your fool's gold

And I knew that you turned it on for everyone you met

But I don't regret

Falling for your fool's gold

Oh

Oh

Oh, hmm

## Night Changes 

Goin' out tonight, changes into somethin' red

Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress

Everything she never had, she's showin' off

Drivin' too fast, moon is breakin' through her hair

She's headin' for somethin' that she won't forget

Havin' no regrets is all that she really wants

(Ooh) We're only gettin' older, baby

(Ooh) And I've been thinkin' about it lately

(Ooh) Does it ever drive you crazy

(Ah-ah-ah) Just how fast the night changes?

(Ooh) Everything that you've ever dreamed of

(Ooh) Disappearin' when you wake up

(Ooh) But there's nothin' to be afraid of

(Ah-ah-ah) Even when the night changes

(Ooh) It will never change me and you

Chasin' her tonight, doubts are runnin' round her head

He's waitin', hides behind a cigarette

Heart is beatin' loud and she doesn't want it to stop

Movin' too fast, moon is lightin' up her skin

She's fallin', doesn't even know it yet

Havin' no regrets is all that she really wants

(Ooh) We're only gettin' older, baby

(Ooh) And I've been thinkin' about it lately

(Ooh) Does it ever drive you crazy

(Ah-ah-ah) Just how fast the night changes?

(Ooh) Everything that you've ever dreamed of

(Ooh) Disappearin' when you wake up

(Ooh) But there's nothin' to be afraid of

(Ah-ah-ah) Even when the night changes

(Ooh) It will never change me and you

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Ooh, ooh, ooh

Ooh

Goin' out tonight, changes into somethin' red

Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress

Reminds her of the missin' piece of innocence she lost

(Ooh) We're only gettin' older, baby

(Ooh) And I've been thinkin' about it lately

(Ooh) Does it ever drive you crazy

(Ah-ah-ah) Just how fast the night changes?

(Ooh) Everything that you've ever dreamed of

(Ooh) Disappearin' when you wake up

(Ooh) But there's nothin' to be afraid of

(Ah-ah-ah) Even when the night changes

(Ooh) It will never change, baby

(Ooh) It will never change, baby

(Ooh) It will never change me and you

## No Control 

Oh

(Oh, oh)

Stained coffee cup

Just a fingerprint of lipstick's not enough

Sweet (Oh), where you lay (Oh)

Still a trace of innocence on the pillow case

Waking up beside you, I'm a loaded gun

I can't contain this anymore

I'm all yours, I've got no control, no control

Powerless, and I don't care it's obvious

I just can't get enough of you

The pedal's down, my eyes are closed, no control

(Oh)

Oh

(Oh)

Taste on my tongue

I don't want to wash away the night before

In the heat (Oh), where you lay (Oh)

I could stay right here and burn in it all day

Waking up beside you, I'm a loaded gun

I can't contain this anymore

I'm all yours, I've got no control, no control

Powerless, and I don't care it's obvious

I just can't get enough of you

The pedal's down, my eyes are closed, no control

Lost my senses, I'm defenseless

Her perfume's holding me ransom

Sweet and sour, heart devoured

Lying here, I count the hours

Waking up, beside you I'm a loaded gun

I can't contain this anymore

I'm all yours, I've got no control, no control

Powerless, and I don't care it's obvious

I just can't get enough of you

The pedal's down, my eyes are closed, no control

Oh

No control

Oh

No control

Powerless, and I don't care it's obvious

I just can't get enough of you

The pedal's down, my eyes are closed, no control

## Fireproof 

I think I'm gonna lose my mind

Something deep inside me, I can't give up

I think I'm gonna lose my mind

I roll and I roll 'til I'm out of luck

Yeah, I roll and I roll 'til I'm out of luck (Ah)

I'm feeling something deep inside (Ah)

Hotter than a jet stream burning up (Ah)

I got a feeling deep inside (Ah)

It's taking, it's taking all I've got (Ah)

Yeah, it's taking, it's taking all I've got

'Cause nobody knows you, baby, the way I do

And nobody loves you, baby, the way I do

It's been so long, it's been so long, maybe you were fireproof

'Cause nobody saves me, baby, the way you do

I think I'm gonna win this time

Ridin' on the wind and I won't give up

I think I'm gonna win this time

I roll and I roll 'til I change my luck

Yeah, I roll and I roll 'til I change my luck (Ah)

'Cause nobody knows you, baby, the way I do

And nobody loves you, baby, the way I do

It's been so long (Ah), it's been so long, you must be fireproof

'Cause nobody saves me, baby, the way you do

('Cause nobody knows you, baby, the way I do)

(And nobody loves you, baby, the way I do)

It's been so long, it's been so long (Ah), maybe you were fireproof

'Cause nobody saves me, baby, the way you do

## Spaces 

Who's gonna be the first one to start the fight?

Who's gonna be the first one to fall asleep at night?

Who's gonna be the last one to drive away?

Who's gonna be the last one to forget this place?

We keep taking turns (Oh-oh-oh-oh)

Will we ever learn?

Oh, spaces between us keep getting deeper

It's harder to reach ya, even though I've tried

Spaces between us hold all our secrets

Leavin' us speechless and I don't know why

Who's gonna be the first to say goodbye?

Bye

Who's gonna be the first one to compromise?

Who's gonna be the first one to set it all on fire?

Who's gonna be the last one to drive away?

Forgetting every single promise we ever made

Oh, spaces between us keep getting deeper

It's harder to reach ya, even though I've tried

Spaces between us hold all our secrets

Leavin' us speechless and I don't know why

Who's gonna be the first to say goodbye?

Leavin' us speechless and I don't know why

Who's gonna be the first to say goodbye?

The spaces between us

The spaces between us

The spaces between us

## Stockholm Syndrome 

Who's that shadow holding me hostage? I've been here for days

Who's this whisper telling me that I'm never gonna get away?

I know they'll be coming to find me soon

But I fear I'm getting used to

Being held by you

Oh, baby, look what you've done to me

Oh, baby, look what you've done now

Oh, baby, I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way (Oh-oh-oh)

Oh, baby, look what you've done to me

Oh, baby, I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way (Oh-oh-oh)

Who's this man that's holding your hand and talking 'bout your eyes? (Oh-oh-oh)

Used to sing about being free but now he's changed his mind (Oh-oh-oh)

I know they'll be coming to find me soon

But my Stockholm syndrome is in your room

Yeah, I fell for you

Oh, baby, look what you've done to me

Oh, baby, look what you've done now

Oh, baby, I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way (Oh-oh-oh)

Oh, baby, look what you've done to me

Oh, baby, you got me tied down

Oh, baby, I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way (Oh-oh-oh)

All my life, I've been on my own (Oh-oh-oh)

I used the light to guide me home (Oh-oh-oh)

But now together we're alone (Oh-oh-oh)

And there's no other place I'd ever wanna go

(Look what you've done to me)

Baby, look what you've done

Oh, baby, look what you've done to me

Oh, baby, look what you've done (Done) now

## Clouds 

Oh-oh-oh-oh (Clouds)

Oh-oh-oh-oh (Clouds)

I know you say that you don't like it complicated

That we should try to keep it simple

But love is never, ever simple, no

Someday, you're gonna see the things that I see

You're gonna want the air that I breathe

You're gonna wish you never left me

Here we go again

Another go-round for all of my friends

## Perfect 

I might never be your knight in shinin' armour

I might never be the one you take home to mother

And I might never be the one who brings you flowers

But I can be the one, be the one tonight

When I first saw you from across the room

I could tell that you were curious, oh, yeah

Girl, I hope you're sure what you're looking for

Or the arms that hold you any time you want them

But that don't mean that we can't live here in the moment

'Cause I can be the one you love from time to time

When I first saw you from across the room

I could tell that you were curious, oh, yeah

Girl, I hope you're sure what you're looking for

## Infinity 

Down to Earth

Keep on falling when I know it hurts

Going faster than a million miles an hour

Tryna catch my breath some way, somehow

Down to Earth

It's like I'm frozen but the world still turns

Stuck in motion and the wheels keep spinning 'round

Moving in reverse with no way out

And now I'm one step closer to being

Two steps far from you

When everybody wants you

Everybody wants you

How many nights does it take to count the stars?

That's the time it would take to fix my heart

Oh, baby, I was there for you

All I ever wanted was the truth, yeah, yeah

How many nights have you wished someone would stay?

Lie awake, only hoping they're okay

I never counted all of mine

If I tried, I know it would feel like infinity

Infinity, infinity, yeah

Infinity

Eyes can't shine

Unless there's something burning bright behind

Since you went away, there's nothing left in mine

I feel myself runnin' out of time

And now I'm one step closer to being

Two steps far from you

When everybody wants you

Everybody wants you

How many nights does it take to count the stars?

That's the time it would take to fix my heart

Oh, baby, I was there for you

All I ever wanted was the truth, yeah, yeah

How many nights have you wished someone would stay?

Lie awake only hoping they're okay

I never counted all of mine

If I tried, I know it would feel like infinity

Infinity, infinity, yeah

Infinity (Infinity, infinity, infinity, infinity)

Infinity (Infinity, infinity, infinity, infinity)

How many nights does it take to count the stars?

That's the time it would take to fix my heart

Oh, baby, I was there for you

All I ever wanted was the truth, yeah, yeah

(All I ever wanted was the truth, yeah, yeah)

How many nights have you wished someone would stay?

Lie awake only hoping they're okay (Yeah, yeah)

I never counted all of mine

If I tried, I know it would feel like infinity (Infinity)

Infinity (Infinity), infinity, yeah

Infinity

## End of the Day 

I told her that I loved her, was not sure if she heard

The roof was pretty windy and she didn't say a word

Party dying downstairs, had nothing left to do

Just me, her and the moon

I said, "You're on fire, babe"

Then down came the lightning on me

Love can be frightening for sure

All I know at the end of the day

Is you want what you want and you say what you say

And you follow your heart even though it'll break sometimes

All I know at the end of the day

Is you love who you love, there ain't no other way

If there's something I've learned from a million mistakes

You're the one that I want at the end of the day

(Oh, oh)

At the end of the day

(Oh, I, I, I)

You're the one that I want at the end of the day

She said the night was over, I said it's forever

Twenty minutes later, wound up in the hospital

The priest thinks it's the devil, my mum thinks it's the flu

But, girl, it's only you

I said, "You're on fire, babe"

Then down came the lightning on me

Love can be frightening for sure

All I know at the end of the day

Is you want what you want and you say what you say

And you follow your heart even though it'll break sometimes

All I know at the end of the day (All I know)

Is you love who you love, there ain't no other way

If there's something I've learned from a million mistakes

You're the one that I want at the end of the day (At the end of the day)

When the sun goes down

I know that you and me and everything will be alright

And when the city's sleeping

You and I can stay awake, can keep on dreaming

You and I can stay awake, can keep on dreaming

All I know at the end of the day

Is you want what you want and you say what you say

And you follow your heart even though it'll break sometimes

All I know at the end of the day (All I know at the end of the day)

Is you love who you love, there ain't no other way

If there's something I've learned from a million mistakes

You're the one that I want at the end of the day (At the end of the day, yeah)

(Oh, oh)

At the end of the day

(Oh, I, I, I)

You're the one that I want at the end of the day (At the end of the day)

(Oh, oh)

(Oh, I, I, I)

You're the one that I want at the end of the day

## If I Could Fly 

If I could fly

I'd be coming right back home to you

I think I might

Give up everything, just ask me to

Pay attention, I hope that you listen

'Cause I let my guard down

Right now, I'm completely defenceless

For your eyes only, I show you my heart

For when you're lonely and forget who you are

I'm missing half of me when we're apart

Now you know me, for your eyes only

For your eyes only

I've got scars

Even though they can't always be seen

And pain gets hard

But now you're here and I don't feel a thing

Pay attention, I hope that you listen

'Cause I let my guard down

Right now, I'm completely defenceless

For your eyes only, I show you my heart

For when you're lonely and forget who you are

I'm missing half of me when we're apart

Now you know me, for your eyes only

For your eyes only

I can feel your heart inside of mine (I feel it, I feel it)

I've been going out of my mind (I feel it, I feel it)

Know that I'm just wasting time (And I)

Hope that you don't run from me

For your eyes only, I show you my heart

For when you're lonely and forget who you are

I'm missing half of me when we're apart

(Now you know me, for your eyes only)

For your eyes only, I show you my heart (Show you my heart)

For when you're lonely and forget who you are (Forget who you are)

I'm missing half of me when we're apart

Now you know me, for your eyes only

For your eyes only

For your eyes only

## Long Way Down 

We made a fire, went down in the flames

We sailed an ocean and drowned in the wave

Built a cathedral, but we never prayed

We had it all, yeah, and we walked away

Point of no return and now it's just too late to turn around

I try to forgive you but I struggle 'cause I don't know how

We built it up so high and now I'm falling

It's a long way down, it's a long way down from here

We had a mountain, but took it for granted

We had a spaceship, but we couldn't land it

We found an island, but we got stranded

We had it all, yeah, who could've planned it?

Point of no return and now it's just too late to turn around

I try to forgive you, but I'm struggling 'cause I don't know how

We built it up so high and now I'm falling

It's a long way down from here

Such a long way down from here

It's a long way down

It's a long way down

Such a long way down

It's a long way down

It's a long way down

## Never Enough 

Wanna pull an all-nighter and get into something we'll never forget

Wanna stay up and party the weekend away and not know when to quit

Wanna drive in the night to the end of the earth and go over the edge

Wanna wake up with you and say, "Baby, let's do it all over again"

Lips so good I forget my name

I swear I could give you everything

I don't need my love, you can take it

You can take it and take it

I don't need my heart, you can break it

You can break it and break it

I just can't get too much of you, baby

It's never, it's never enough

Never enough

It's never enough

Never enough

Come on

## Olivia 

Forty-three

And then?

And then you've gotta play the opposite part which means you, you rest for four bars

Right, so we stop there?

Right

Remember the day we were giving up

When you told me I didn't give you enough

And all of your friends were saying I'd be leaving ya?

She's lyin' in bed with my t-shirt on

Just thinking how I went about it wrong

This isn't the stain of a red wine, I'm bleeding love

Please, believe me, don't you see the things you mean to me?

Oh, I love you, I love you, I love, I love, I love Olivia

I live for you, I long for you, Olivia (Ayy, ayy)

I've been idolizing the light in your eyes, Olivia (Ayy, ayy)

I live for you, I long for you, Olivia

Don't let me go, don't let me go

Say what you're feelin' and say it now

'Cause I got the feelin' you're walkin' out

And time is irrelevant when I've not been seeing ya

The consequences of falling out

Are something I'm having nightmares about

And these are the reasons I'm cryin' out to be with ya

Please, believe me, don't you see the things you mean to me?

Oh, I love you, I love you, I love, I love, I love Olivia

I live for you, I long for you, Olivia (Ayy, ayy)

I've been idolizing the light in your eyes, Olivia (Ayy, ayy)

I live for you, I long for you, Olivia

Don't let me go, (Don't) don't let me go (Go)

When you go and I'm alone

You live in my imagination

The summertime and butterflies

All belong to your creation

I love you, it's all I do, I love you

I live for you, I long for you, Olivia (Ayy, ayy)

I've been idolizing the light in your eyes, Olivia (Ayy, ayy)

I live for you, I long for you, Olivia

Don't let me go (Don't), don't let me go (Go)

Don't let me go, Olivia

No way

Thank you

## What a Feeling 

Through the wire, through the wire, through the wire

I'm watching her dance, dress is catching the light

In her eyes, there's no lies, no lies

There's no question, she's not in a disguise

With no way out and a long way down

Everybody needs someone around

But I can't hold you too close now

Through the wire, through the wire

What a feeling to be right here beside you now

Holding you in my arms

When the air ran out and we both started running wild

The sky fell down

But you've got stars, they're in your eyes

And I've got something missing tonight

What a feeling to be a king beside you, somehow

I wish I could be there now

Through the wire, through the wire, through the wire

I'm watching you like this, imaginin' you're mine

It's too late, it's too late, am I too late?

Tell me now, am I runnin' out of time?

With no way out and a long way down

Everybody needs someone around

But I can't hold you too close now

Through the wire, through the wire

What a feeling to be right here beside you now

Holding you in my arms

When the air ran out and we both started running wild

The sky fell down

But you've got stars, they're in your eyes

And I've got something missing tonight

What a feeling to be a king beside you, somehow

I wish I could be there now

Whatever chains are holdin' you back

Holdin' you back, don't let 'em tie you down

Whatever change is holdin' you back

Holdin' you back, tell me you believe in that

What a feeling to be right here beside you now

Holding you in my arms

When the air ran out and we both started running wild

The sky fell down

But you've got stars, they're in your eyes

And I've got something missing tonight

What a feeling to be a king beside you, somehow

I wish I could be there now

I wish I could be there now

## Love You Goodbye 

It's inevitable, everything that's good comes to an end

It's impossible to know if after this we can still be friends, yeah

I know you're sayin' you don't wanna hurt me

Well, maybe you should show a little mercy

The way you look, I know you didn't come to apologise

Hey, hey, hey

Oh, why you wearing that to walk out of my life?

Hey, hey, hey

Oh, even though it's over, you should stay tonight

Hey, hey, hey

If tomorrow you won't be mine

Won't you give it to me one last time?

Oh, baby, let me love you goodbye

Unforgettable together, held the whole world in our hands

Unexplainable, a love that only we could understand, yeah

I know there's nothing I can do to change it

But is there something that can be negotiated?

My heart's already breaking, baby, go on, twist the knife

Hey, hey, hey

Oh, why you wearing that to walk out of my life?

Hey, hey, hey

Oh, even though it's over, you should stay tonight

Hey, hey, hey

If tomorrow you won't be mine

Won't you give it to me one last time?

Oh, baby, let me love you goodbye

Oh, baby, let me love you goodbye

One more taste of your lips just to bring me back

To the places we've been and the nights we've had

Because if this is it, then at least we could end it right

Oh, why you wearing that to walk out of my life?

Hey, hey, hey

Oh, even though it's over, you should stay the night, yeah

Hey, hey, hey

If tomorrow you won't be mine

Won't you give it to me one last time?

Oh, baby, let me love you goodbye

Oh, baby, let me love you goodbye

Oh, baby, let me love you goodbye

## I Want to Write You a Song 

I wanna write you a song

One as beautiful as you are sweet

With just a hint of pain

For the feeling that I get when you are gone

I wanna write you a song

I wanna lend you my coat

One that's as soft as your cheek

So when the world is cold

You will have a hiding place you can go

I wanna lend you my coat

Ooh, everything I need I get from you

Ooh, and giving back is all I wanna do

I wanna build you a boat

One as strong as you are free

So any time you think

That your heart is gonna sink, you know it won't

I wanna build you a boat

Ooh, everything I need I get from you

Ooh, and giving back is all I wanna do, ooh

Ooh, everything I need I get from you

Ooh, giving back is all I wanna do, ooh

I wanna write you a song

One to make your heart remember me

So any time I'm gone

You can listen to my voice and sing along

I wanna write you a song

I wanna write you a song

## History 

You gotta help me

I'm losing my mind

Keep getting the feelin'

You wanna leave this all behind

Thought we were going strong

I thought we were holdin' on

Aren't we?

No, they don't teach ya

This in school

Now my heart's breakin'

And I don't know what to do

Thought we were going strong

I thought we were holdin' on

Aren't we?

You and me got a whole lot of history (Oh)

We could be the greatest team

That the world has ever seen

You and me got a whole lot of history (Oh)

So don't let it go, we can make some more

We can live forever

All of the rumours

All of the fights

But we always find a way

To make it out alive

Thought we were going strong

Thought we were holdin' on

Aren't we?

You and me got a whole lot of history (Oh)

We could be the greatest team

That the world has ever seen

You and me got a whole lot of history (Oh)

So don't let it go, we can make some more

We can live forever

Minibars, expensive cars

Hotel rooms and new tattoos

The good champagne and private planes

But they don't mean anything

'Cause the truth is out, I realise

That without you here, life is just a lie

This is not the end, this is not the end

We can make it, you know it, you know

You and me got a whole lot of history (Oh)

We could be the greatest team

That the world has ever seen

You and me got a whole lot of history (Oh)

So don't let it go, we can make some more

We can live forever

You and me got a whole lot of history (Oh)

We could be the greatest team

That the world has ever seen

You and me got a whole lot of history (Oh)

So don't let it go, we can make some more

We can live forever

So don't let me go, so don't let me go

We can live forever

Baby, don't you know? Baby, don't you know?

We can live forever
