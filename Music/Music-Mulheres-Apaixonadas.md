# Dont't know why   Norah Jones

[Verse 1]

I waited 'til I saw the sun

I don't know why I didn't come

I left you by the house of fun

I don't know why I didn't come

I don't know why I didn't come

[Verse 2]

When I saw the break of day

I wished that I could fly away

Instead of kneeling in the sand

Catching teardrops in my hand

[Refrain]

My heart is drenched in wine

But you'll be on my mind forever

[Verse 3]

Out across the endless sea

I would die in ecstasy

But I'll be a bag of bones

Driving down the road alone

[Refrain]

My heart is drenched in wine

But you'll be on my mind forever

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]

Something has to make you run

I don't know why I didn't come

I feel as empty as a drum

[Outro]

I don't know why I didn't come

I don't know why I didn't come

I don't know why I didn't come

# Disease   Matchbox Twenty

[Verse 1]

Feels like you made a mistake

You made somebody's heart break

But now I have to let you go

I have to let you go

[Verse 2]

You left a stain

On every one of my good days

But I am stronger than you know

I have to let you go

[Pre-Chorus 1]

No one's ever turned you over

No one's tried

To ever let you down

Beautiful girl, bless your heart

[Chorus]

I got a disease

Deep inside me

Makes me feel uneasy, baby

I can't live without you

Tell me what am I s'posed to do about it

Keep your distance from it

Don't pay no attention to me

I got a disease

[Verse 3]

Feels like you're makin' a mess

You're hell on wheels in a black dress

You drove me to the fire

And left me there to burn

[Pre-Chorus 2]

Every little thing you do is tragic

All my life before was magic

Beautiful girl

I can't breathe

[Chorus]

I got a disease

Deep inside me

Makes me feel uneasy, baby

I can't live without you

Tell me what am I s'posed to do about it

Keep your distance from it

Don't pay no attention to me

I got a disease

[Bridge]

Yeah well I think that I'm sick

Better leave me be

While my world is coming down on me

You taste like honey, honey

Tell me can I be your honey

Bee, be strong

Keep tellin' myself that it won't take long 'til

I'm free of my disease

Yeah, well, free of my disease

Free of my disease, oh

[Chorus]

I got a disease

Deep inside me

Makes me feel uneasy, baby

I can't live without you

Tell me what am I supposed to do about it

Keep your distance from it

Don't pay no attention to me

I got a disease

[Bridge]

Yeah, well, I think that I'm sick

Better leave me be

While my world is comin' down on me

You taste like honey, honey

Tell me can I be your honey

Bee, be strong

Keep tellin' myself that it won't take long 'til

I'm free of my disease

Yeah, well, free of my disease

Set me free of my disease

Oh, yeah

# I'm with you   Avril Lavigne

[Verse 1]

I'm standin' on the bridge

I'm waitin' in the dark

I thought that you'd be here by now

There's nothing but the rain

No footsteps on the ground

I'm listening, but there's no sound

[Pre-Chorus]

Isn't anyone tryna find me?

Won't somebody come take me home?

[Chorus]

It's a damn cold night

Tryna figure out this life

Won't you take me by the hand, take me somewhere new?

I don't know who you are, but I

I'm with you

I'm with you, mmm

[Verse 2]

I'm lookin' for a place

I'm searchin' for a face

Is anybody here? I know

'Cause nothing's going right

And everything's a mess

And no one likes to be alone

[Pre-Chorus]

Isn't anyone tryna find me?

Won't somebody come take me home?

[Chorus]

It's a damn cold night

Tryna figure out this life

Won't you take me by the hand, take me somewhere new?

I don't know who you are, but I

I'm with you

I'm with you, yeah, yeah

[Bridge]

Oh, why is everything so confusing?

Maybe I'm just out of my mind

Yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah

Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah

Yeah

[Chorus]

It's a damn cold night

Tryna figure out this life

Won't you take me by the hand, take me somewhere new?

I don't know who you are, but I

I'm with you

I'm with you

Take me by the hand, take me somewhere new

I don't know who you are, but I

I'm with you

I'm with you

Take me by the hand, take me somewhere new

I don't know who you are, but I

[Outro]

I'm with you, oh

I'm with you

I'm with you

# Nothing at all   Santana E Musiq

[Verse 1]

I am a victim of my time

A product of my age

There's no choosing my direction

I was a holy man but now

With all my trials behind me

I am weak in my conviction

[PreChorus]

And so I walk to try to get away

Knowing that someday I will finally have to face

The fear that will come from knowing that

The one thing I had left was you

And now you're gone

[Verse 2]

You were a victim of my crimes

A product of my rage

You were a beautiful distraction

I kept you locked away outside

Let misery provide

And now I am ashamed

[PreChorus]

And so I walk to try to find a space

Where I can be alone to live with my mistakes

And the fear that will come

From knowing that the one thing

I had left was you

And now you're gone

[Chorus]

(Is there nothing at all)

That I can do to turn your heart?

(Is there nothing to lean on)

That can help erase the scars?

(Te quiero)

And I can use a little strength before I fall

Is there nothing at all?

[Verse 3]

I am victim of my time

A product of my age

You alone are my obsession

You were the one I left behind

You've been heavy on my mind

It's been a lonely road I've traveled

[PreChorus]

And so I walk to try to get away

Knowing that someday I will finally have to face

The fear that will come from knowing that

The one thing I had left was you

And now you're gone

[Chorus]

(Is there nothing at all)

That I can do to turn your heart?

(Is there nothing to lean on)

That can help erase the scars?

(Te quiero)

And I can use a little strength before I fall

Is there nothing at all?

[Chorus]

(Is there nothing at all)

That I can do to turn your heart?

(Is there nothing to lean on)

That can help erase the scars?

(Te quiero)

And I can use a little strength before I fall

Is there nothing at all?

# You belong to me   Jennifer Lopez

[Verse 1]

Why'd you tell me this?

Were you looking for my reaction?

What do you need to know?

Don't you know Iâ€™ll always be your girl?

[Pre-Chorus]

You don't have to prove to me you're beautiful to strangers

I've got loving eyes of my own

[Chorus]

You belong to me

Tell her, tell her you were fooling

You belong to me

You don't even know her

You belong to me

Tell her that I love you

You belong to me

[Verse 2]

You belong to me

Can it be funny, that you're not sure?

You belong to me

Thought we'd close the book and lock the door

[Pre-Chorus]

You don't have to prove to me you're beautiful to strangers

I've got loving eyes of my own, of my own

And I can tell, I can tell, darling

[Chorus]

Tell her

You belong to me

Tell her that I love her

You belong to me

You belong, you belong, you belong to me

You belong to me

Tell her, tell her you were fooling

You belong to me

Tell her she don't even know you

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]

Tell her

You belong to me

Tell her you were fooling

You belong to me

I know from a long time ago, baby

You belong to me

Don't make me go to her house

You belong to me

You belong, you belong, you belong to me

You belong to me

[Outro]

You belong to me (You belong to me)

You belong to me (You belong to me)

You belong to me (Mine, you're mine, you belong to me)

You belong to me (You belong to me)

You belong to me (You belong to me)

You belong to me (You belong to me)

You belong to me (You belong to me)

You belong to me (You belong to me)

You belong to me (You belong to me)

# Vivir sin aire   Mana

[Verse 1]

Should I?

Could I have said the wrong things right a thousand times?

If I could just rewind, I see it in my mind

If I could turn back time, you'd still be mine

You cried, I died

I should have shut my mouth, things headed south

As the words slipped off my tongue, they sounded dumb

If this old heart could talk, it'd say you're the one

I'm wasting time when I think about it

[Chorus]

I should have drove all night

I would have run all the lights

I was misunderstood

I stumbled like my words

Did the best I could

Damn, misunderstood

[Verse 2]

Could I?

Should I apologize for sleeping on the couch that night?

Staying out too late with all my friends

You found me passed out in the yard again

You cried, I tried

To stretch the truth, but didn't lie

It's not so bad when you think about it

[Chorus]

I should have drove all night

I would have run all the lights

I was misunderstood

I stumbled like my words

Did the best I could

Damn, misunderstood

Intentions good

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]

It's you and I, just think about it

[Chorus]

I should have drove all night

I would have run all the lights

I was misunderstood

I stumbled like my words

Did the best I could

I'm hanging outside your door

I've been here before

Misunderstood

I stumbled like my words

Did the best I could

Damn, misunderstood

Intentions good

# Misunderstood   Bon Jovi

As the words slipped off my tongue, they sounded dumb

# Sexed up   Robbie Williams

[Verse 1]

Loose lips, sunk ships

I'm getting to grips

With what you said

No, it's not in my head

I can't awaken the dead day after day

[Pre-Chorus 1]

Why don't we talk about it?

Why do you always doubt

That there can be a better way?

It doesn't make me wanna stay

[Chorus]

Why don't we break up?

There's nothing left to say

I've got my eyes shut

Praying they won't stray

And we're not sexed up

That's what makes the difference today

I hope you blow away

[Verse 2]

You say we're fatally flawed

Well, I'm easily bored

Is that okay?

Write me off your list

Make this the last kiss

I'll walk away

[Pre-Chorus 2]

Why don't we talk about it?

I'm only here, don't shout it

Given time, we'll forget

Let's pretend we never met

[Chorus]

Why don't we break up?

There's nothing left to say

I've got my eyes shut

Praying they won't stray

And we're not sexed up

That's what makes the difference today

I hope you blow away

[Bridge]

Screw you

I didn't like your taste anyway

I chose you

And that's all gone to waste

It's Saturday, I'll go out and find another you

[Chorus]

Why don't we

Why don't we break up?

There's nothing left to say

I've got my eyes shut

Praying they won't stray

And we're not sexed up

That's what makes the difference today

I hope you blow away

[Outro]

I hope you blow away

I hope you blow away

I hope you blow away

Blow away

Blow away

Just not today

# Imbranato   Tiziano Ferro

[Testo di "Imbranato"]

[Strofa 1]

Ãˆ iniziato tutto per un tuo capricclo

Io non mi fidavo, era solo sesso

Ma il sesso Ã¨ un'attitudine

Come l'arte in genere

E forse l'ho capito e sono qui

Scusa sai se provo a insistere

Divento insopportabile, lo so

Ma ti amo, ti amo, ti amo

Ci risiamo, va bene, Ã¨ antico, ma ti amo

[Ritornello]

E scusa se ti amo e se ci conosciamo

Da due mesi o poco piÃ¹

E scusa se non parlo piano

Ma se non urlo muoio

Non so se sai che ti amo

E scusami se rido, dall'imbarazzo cedo

Ti guardo fisso e tremo

All'idea di averti accanto

E sentirmi tuo soltanto

E sono qui che parlo emozionato

E sono un imbranato

E sono un imbranato

[Strofa 2]

Ciao, come stai? Domanda inutile

Ma a me l'amore mi rende prevedibile

Parlo poco, lo so, Ã¨ strano, guido piano

SarÃ  il vento, sarÃ  il tempo, sarÃ  fuoco

[Ritornello]

E scusa se ti amo e se ci conosciamo

Da due mesi o poco piÃ¹

E scusa se non parlo piano

Ma se non urlo muoio

Non so se sai che ti amo

E scusami se rido, dall'imbarazzo cedo

Ti guardo fisso e tremo

All'idea di averti accanto

E sentirmi tuo soltanto

E sono qui che parlo emozionato, sÃ¬

E sono un imbranato

E sono un imbranato

Oh, sÃ¬

Ah, ma ti amo

[Outro Strumentale]

# The way you look tonight   Rod Stewart

Someday, when I'm awfully low

When the world is cold

I will feel a glow

Just thinking of you

And the way you look tonight

You're so lovely

With your smile so warm

And your cheeks so soft

There is nothing for me

But to love you

And the way you look tonight

With each word your tenderness grows

Tearing my fears apart

And that laugh

That wrinkles your nose

Touches my foolish heart

Yes, you're lovely

Never, ever change

Keep that breathless charm

Won't you please arrange it

'Cause I love you

Just the way you look tonight

With each word your tenderness grows

Tearing my fears apart

And that laugh

That wrinkles your nose

Touches my foolish heart

Yes,you're lovely

Never, ever change

Keep that breathless charm

Won't you please arrange it

'Cause I love you

Just the way you look to-night

Just the way you look to-night, darling!

Just the way you look to-night

# Noche de ronda   Paolo

Noche de Ronda

Que triste pasas

Que triste cruzas

Por mi balcÃ³n

Noche de ronda

Como me hieres

Como lÃ¡stimas

Mi corazÃ³n

Luna que se quiebra

Sobre la tiniebla

De mi soledad

A dÃ³nde vas?

Dime se esta noche

TÃº te vas de ronda

Como ella se fue

Con quiÃ©n estÃ¡s?

Dile que la quiero

Dile que me muero

De tanto esperar

Que vuelve ya

Que las rondas no son buenas

Que hacen daÃ±o, que dan penas

Y que acaban por llorar

# Te dejo Madrid   Shakira

[Intro]

Ooh!

Ah-ah

[Verso 1]

SÃ­, ya es hora de esconder

Del mundo el dolor bajo la piel

Mas sÃ© que estarÃ© bien

Los gatos, como yo, caen de pie

No quiero jugar mi suerte por ti

No puedo con v pequeÃ±a vivir

Pronto estarÃ© de aquÃ­ muy, muy lejos

[Coro]

Ay, me voy otra vez

Ay, te dejo, Madrid

Tus rutinas de piel y tus ganas de huir

Yo no quiero cobardes que me hagan sufrir

Mejor le digo adiÃ³s a tu boca de anÃ­s

[Verso 2]

SÃ­, ya es hora de limpiar las manchas de miel

Sobre el mantel

Yo nunca supe actuar

Y mis labios se ven muertos de sed

No quiero dejarlo todo al azar

Entiendo que he comenzado a estorbar

Pronto estarÃ© de ti muy, muy lejos

[Coro]

Ay, me voy otra vez

Ay, te dejo, Madrid

Tus rutinas de piel y tus ganas de huir

Yo no quiero cobardes que me hagan sufrir

Mejor le digo adiÃ³s a tu boca de anÃ­s

Ah, ah

[Instrumental]

[Coro]

Ay, me voy otra vez

Tus rutinas de piel y tus ganas de huir

Yo no quiero cobardes que me hagan sufrir

Mejor le digo adiÃ³s a tu boca de...

Yo no quiero cobardes que me hagan sufrir

Ay, te dejo, Madrid, Madrid

A tu boca de anÃ­s

# Hurt you so bad   Crazy Town

[Verse 1: Shifty Shellshock, Bret "Epic" Mazur, both]

Now let me state it for the record, I'm jaded

But when you looked at me, I couldn't escape it

I really hate it when I'm outta control

But, baby, after the show my mind just wouldn't let go

Tell me, was it a hallucination (hallucination)

That made me feel so alone (so alone)?

And even though I had never met you before

Can't get you outta my head

Now I'm pourin' out my heart for you

[Chorus: Epic and Shifty]

I never meant to hurt you so bad

I'm just tryin' to get over you

I hope you never meant to hurt me so bad

Don't you feel the same way too?

I never meant to hurt you so bad

I never meant to hurt you

[Verse 2: Bret "Epic" Mazur]

So now I sit and think of what I could say when

You look at me to reignite the connection

I'm gonna take you to a place beyond time

Somewhere that we've never been

Someplace that I couldn't find

Tell me if you're feeling my addiction (my addiction)

Without you, I just can't disguise (can't disguise)

How much I need to see your face one more time

Can't get you outta my head

Now I'm pourin' out my heart for you

[Chorus: Epic and Shifty]

I never meant to hurt you so bad

I'm just tryin' to get over you

I hope you never meant to hurt me so bad

Don't you feel the same way too?

I never meant to hurt you so bad

I never meant to hurt you

[Guitar Solo: Rivers Cuomo]

[Bridge: Epic and Shifty]

Uh-huh

Yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Epic and Shifty]

I never meant to hurt you so bad

I'm just tryin' to get over you

I hope you never meant to hurt me so bad

Don't you feel the same way too?

I never meant to hurt you so bad

I never meant to hurt you

[Outro: Epic and Shifty]

Uh-huh

Yeah, yeah

I never meant to hurt you
