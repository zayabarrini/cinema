# Wasted Love  

I'm an ocean of love

And you're scared of water

You don't want to go under

So you let me go under

I reach out my hand

But you watch me grow distant

Drift out to the sea and

Far away in an instant

You left me in the deep end

I'm drownin' in my feelings

How do you not see that?

Now that you're gone

All I have

Is wasted love

This wasted love

Now that you're gone

Can't fill my heart

With wasted love

This wasted love

When you let me go

I barely stayed afloat

I'm floatin' all alone

Still, I'm holdin' on to hope

Now that you're gone

All I have

Is wasted love

This wasted love

Now that you're gone

Can't fill my heart

With wasted love

This wasted love

Wasted love

This wasted

Wasted, wasted, wasted, wasted

Wasted, wasted, wasted, wasted

Love (Wasted, wasted, wasted, wasted)

Love

# I'm In Love With a Monster  

Oh

He'll buy me a thorn before he'll buy me a rose

Be covered in dirt before I'm covered in gold

He's trying it on, yeah, he's ticking me off

Say what you want, but I won't ever be told

'Cause I'm in love with a monster

(Ooh, ooh, ah-ooh)

Friends say I'm stupid and I'm out of my mind

But without you, boy, I'd be bored all the time

No, I don't really care for the same conversation

Got everythin' I need and I'd rather be chasing

Chasing love with a monster

Wrap me in leather before you wrap me in lace

We breakin' rules like we changing the game

He's tryin' it on, and he's ticking me off

Say what you want, but I won't ever be told

I'm in love with a monster with a monster

(Ooh, ooh, ah-ooh)

My nana told me I should have better taste

But I'd rather pay to see the look on her face

No, I don't really care for the lame conversation

Got everything I need, and I'd rather be chasing

Chasing love with a monster

# Touch It  

How do I make the phone ring?

Why do I even care?

How are you all around me, when you're not really there? (Mm)

When you're not really there? (Hey, yeah, mm)

How do I feel you on me, when you're not on my skin?

Why do you say you want me, then tell me you're not coming in? (Ah, yeah)

Baby, just come on in (Mm, yeah)

'Cause every time I'm with you, I go into a zone

And I remember all the places you wanna go

Take me all the way (Ooh)

Ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it

'Cause every time I see you, I don't wanna behave

I'm tired of being patient, so let's pick up the pace

Take me all the way (Ooh)

Ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it

How do you know I'm breathing, when I'm holding my breath?

Why don't we face the danger, just for the night and forget? (Ayy)

Baby, let's just forget (No-oh)

Remind me why we're taking a break

It's obviously insane

'Cause we both know what we want

So why don't we fall in love?

Baby, let's fall in love, oh-oh

'Cause every time I'm with you, I go into a zone

And I remember all the places you wanna go

Take me all the way (Ooh)

Ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it

'Cause every time I see you, I don't wanna behave

I'm tired of being patient, so let's pick up the pace

Take me all the way (Ooh)

Ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it

Oh, ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it

Baby, ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it (Ain't no-bo-dy, babe)

Baby, ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it (Oh)

Ain't nobody gonna touch it (Oh, no, ayy)

Remind me why we're taking a break

It's obviously insane

'Cause we both know what we want

So why don't we fall in love?

Baby, let's be in love

'Cause every time I'm with you, I go into a zone

And I remember all the places you wanna go

Take me all the way (Ooh)

No, ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it (Ain't nobody gonna)

'Cause every time I see you, I don't wanna behave (Behave)

I'm tired of being patient, so let's pick up the pace

# Save Me  

Loving you like I never have before

I'm needing you to open up the door

If begging you might somehow turn the tides

Then tell me to I've got to get this off my mind

I never thought I'd be speaking these words

I never thought I'd need to say

Another day alone is more than I can take

Won't you save me

Saving is what I need

I just want to be by your side

Won't you save me I don't want to be

Just drifting through the sea of life

Won't you

Listen, please baby, don't walk out that door

I'm on my knees you're all I'm living for

I never thought I'd be speaking these words

Heaven thought I'd find a way

Another day alone is more than I can take

Won't you save me

Saving is what I need

I just want to be by your side

Won't you save me I don't want to be

Just drifting through the sea of life

If suddenly the sky is falling

Could it be too late for me

If I never said I'm sorry, then I'm wrong, yes, I'm wrong

Then I hear my spirit calling

Wondering if she's longing for me

And then I know that I can't live without her

Won't you save me

Saving is what I need

I just want to be by your side

Won't you save me I don't want to be

Just drifting through this sea of life

Won't you save me

Won't you save me

Won't you save me

# Jar of hearts  

No, I can't take one more step towards you

'Cause all that's waiting is regret

And don't you know I'm not your ghost anymore?

You lost the love I loved the most

I learned to live half alive

And now you want me one more time

And who do you think you are?

Runnin' 'round leaving scars

Collecting your jar of hearts

And tearing love apart

You're gonna catch a cold

From the ice inside your soul

So don't come back for me

Who do you think you are?

I hear you're asking all around

If I am anywhere to be found

I have grown too strong

To ever fall back in your arms

I've learned to live half alive

And now you want me one more time

And who do you think you are?

Runnin' 'round leaving scars

Collecting your jar of hearts

And tearing love apart

You're gonna catch a cold

From the ice inside your soul

So don't come back for me

Who do you think you are?

It took so long just to feel alright

Remember how to put back the light in my eyes

I wish I had missed the first time that we kissed

'Cause you broke all your promises

And now you're back

You don't get to get me back

And who do you think you are?

Runnin' 'round leaving scars

Collecting your jar of hearts

And tearing love apart

You're gonna catch a cold

From the ice inside your soul

Don't come back for me

Don't come back at all

And who do you think you are?

Runnin' 'round leaving scars

Collecting your jar of hearts

And tearing love apart

You're gonna catch a cold

From the ice inside your soul

Don't come back for me

Don't come back at all

Who do you think you are?

Who do you think you are?

Who do you think you are?

# Need You Now  

"Hey, sorry I missed your call, just leave a message after the beep"

"Hey, yeah, it's me, just been thinking about everything tonight

And I don't know, I just miss you so much

Give me a call back if you can?"

Picture-perfect memories scattered all around the floor

Reachin' for the phone 'cause I can't fight it anymore

And I wonder if I ever cross your mind

For me, it happens all the time

It's a quarter after 1, I'm all alone and I need you now

Said I wouldn't call, but I've lost all control and I need you now

And I don't know how I can do without

I just need you now

Another shot of whiskey, can't stop lookin' at the door

Wishing you'd come sweeping in the way you did before

And I wonder if I ever cross your mind

For me, it happens all the time

It's a quarter after 1, I'm a little drunk and I need you now

Said I wouldn't call, but I've lost all control and I need you now

And I don't know how I can do without

I just need you now

Woah, oh

I guess I'd rather hurt than feel nothin' at all

It's a quarter after 1, I'm all alone and I need you now

And I said I wouldn't call, but I'm a little drunk and I need you now

And I don't know how I can do without

I just need you now

I just need you now

Oh, baby, I need you now

# somebody that i used to know  

Now and then, I think of when we were together

Like when you said you felt so happy, you could die

I told myself that you were right for me

But felt so lonely in your company

But that was love and it's an ache I still remember

You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness

Like resignation to the end, always the end

So when we found that we could not make sense

Well, you said that we would still be friends

But I'll admit that I was glad it was over

But you didn't have to cut me off

Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing

And I don't even need your love

But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough

No, you didn't have to stoop so low

Have your friends collect your records and then change your number

I guess that I don't need that, though

Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Now and then, I think of all the times you screwed me over

But had me believing it was always something that I'd done

But I don't wanna live that way

Reading into every word you say

You said that you could let it go

And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know

But you didn't have to cut me off

Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing (Ah)

And I don't even need your love (Ohh)

But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough (Ah)

No, you didn't have to stoop so low (Ohh)

Have your friends collect your records and then change your number (Ah)

I guess that I don't need that, though (Ohh)

Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Somebody (I used to know)

Somebody (Now you're just somebody that I used to know)

Somebody (I used to know)

Somebody (Now you're just somebody that I used to know)

(I used to know)

(That I used to know)

(I used to know)

Somebody

# Shake It Out  

Regrets collect like old friends

Here to relive your darkest moments

I can see no way, I can see no way

And all of the ghouls come out to play

And every demon wants his pound of flesh

But I like to keep some things to myself

I'd like to keep my issues drawn

It's always darkest before the dawn

And I've been a fool and I've been blind

I can never leave the past behind

I can see no way, I can see no way

I'm always dragging that horse around

All of his questions, such a mournful sound

Tonight, I'm gonna bury that horse in the ground

'Cause I like to keep my issues drawn

But it's always darkest before the dawn

Shake it out, shake it out

Shake it out, shake it out, oh-woah

Shake it out, shake it out

Shake it out, shake it out, oh-woah

And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back

So shake him off, oh-woah

And I am done with my graceless heart

So tonight, I'm gonna cut it out and then restart

'Cause I like to keep my issues drawn

It's always darkest before the dawn

Shake it out, shake it out

Shake it out, shake it out, oh-woah

Shake it out, shake it out

Shake it out, shake it out, oh-woah

And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back

So shake him off, oh-woah (Shake him off)

And it's hard to dance

With a devil on your back (Shake him off)

And given half the chance

Would I take any of it back? (Shake him off)

It's a fine romance

But it's left me so undone (Shake him off)

It's always darkest before the dawn (Shake him off)

(Oh-woah)

(Oh-woah)

And I'm damned if I do and I'm damned if I don't

So here's to drinks in the dark at the end of my rope

And I'm ready to suffer and I'm ready to hope

It's a shot in the dark aimed right at my throat

'Cause lookin' for Heaven, found the devil in me (Oh-woah)

Looking for Heaven, found the devil in me (Oh-woah)

But what the hell, I'm gonna let it happen to me, yeah

Shake it out, shake it out

Shake it out, shake it out, oh-woah

Shake it out, shake it out

Shake it out, shake it out, oh-woah

And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back

So shake him off, oh-woah

Shake it out, shake it out

Shake it out, shake it out, oh-woah

Shake it out, shake it out

Shake it out, shake it out, oh-woah

And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back

So shake him off, oh-woah

(What the hell) Oh-oh-oh-oh

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Oh-oh-oh-oh

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Oh-oh-oh-oh

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

# You Get What You Give  

Uh

Cha-cha-cha-cha, cha-cha-cha-cha-cha (ooh)

Cha-cha-cha-cha-cha, cha-cha-cha-cha

Do you know it, do you know it, do you know it, do you know it

One, two!

One, two, three, ow!

Oh, oh, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

Wake up, kids, we got the dreamers' disease

Age fourteen, they got you down on your knees

So polite, we're busy still saying please

Frenemies, who, when you're down, ain't your friend

Every night we smash a Mercedes-Benz

First we run, and then we laugh 'til we cry

But when the night is falling

You cannot find the light (Light)

You feel your dreams are dying, hold tight

You've got the music in you

Don't let go, you've got the music in you

One dance left, this world is gonna pull through

Don't give up, you've got a reason to live

Can't forget, we only get what we give

I'm comin' home, baby

You're the tops

Give it to me now!

Four A.M., we ran a miracle mile

We're flat broke, but hey, we do it in style

The bad rich, God's flying in for your trial

But when the night is falling

You cannot find a friend (Friend)

You feel your tree is breaking, just bend

You've got the music in you

Don't let go, you've got the music in you

One dance left, this world is gonna pull through

Don't give up, you've got a reason to live

Can't forget, we only get what we give

This whole damn world could fall apart

You'll be okay, follow your heart

You're in harm's way, I'm right behind

Now say you're mine

You've got the music in you

Don't let go, you've got the music in you

One dance left, this world is gonna pull through

Don't give up, you've got a reason to live

Can't forget, we only get what we give

Don't let go, I feel the music in you

Don't let go

Fly (fly) high

What's real can't die

You only get what you give

You're gonna get what you give

Don't give up

Just don't be afraid to live

Health insurance, rip-off, lying

FDA, big bankers buying

Fake computer crashes dining

Cloning while they're multiplying

Fashion shoots with Beck and Hanson (Don't give up)

Courtney Love and Marilyn Manson

You're all fakes, run to your mansions

Come around, we'll kick your ass in

Don't let go

One dance left

Don't give up

Can't forget

Don't let go

# In My Life  

There are places I remember

All my life, though some have changed (Ooh, ooh, ooh)

Some forever, not for better

Some have gone and some remain (Ooh, ooh, ooh)

All these places had their moments

With lovers and friends, I still can recall

Some are dead and some are living

In my life, I've loved them all

But of all these friends and lovers

There is no one compares with you (Ooh, ooh, ooh)

And these memories lose their meaning

When I think of love as something new (Ooh, ooh, ooh)

Though I know I'll never lose affection

For people and things that went before

I know I'll often stop and think about them

In my life, I love you more

Though I know I'll never lose affection

For people and things that went before

I know I'll often stop and think about them

In my life, I love you more

In my life, I love you more

# Paradise By The Dashboard Light  

Well, I remember every little thing

As if it happened only yesterday

Parking by the lake

And there was not another car in sight

And I never had a girl

Looking any better than you did

And all the kids at school

They were wishing they were me that night

And now our bodies are oh-so close and tight

It never felt so good, it never felt so right

And we're glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife

Glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife

Come on (Hold tight)

Oh, come on (Hold tight)

Though it's cold and lonely in the deep dark night

I can see paradise by the dashboard light

Though it's cold and lonely in the (deep dark) {Night}

In the deep dark night

Paradise by the (Dashboard light)

We're gonna go all the way tonight

We're gonna go all the way

And tonight's the night

We're gonna go all the way tonight

We're gonna go all the way

And tonight's the night

We're gonna go all the way tonight

We're gonna go all the way

And tonight's the night

We're gonna go all the way tonight

We're gonna go all the way

And tonight's the night

(Night!) Stop right there

I gotta know right now

Before we go any further

Do you love me?

Will you love me forever?

Do you need me?

Will you never leave me?

Will you make me so happy

For the rest of my life?

Will you take me away

And will you make me your wife?

Let me sleep on it (Sleep on it)

Baby, baby let me sleep on it (Sleep on it)

Let me sleep on it (Oooooh, oooooh)

And I'll give you an answer in the {morning}

I gotta know right now

Do you love me? (Do you, do you love me?)

Will you love me forever?

Do you need me? (Do you, do you need me?)

Will you never leave me?

Will you make me so happy (Will you never leave me)

For the rest of my life?

Will you take me away (Do you, do you, do you)

And will you make me your wife?

(with New Directions: Uh, do you love me?)

Will you love me forever?

Let me sleep on it

Will you love me forever?

Let me sleep on it

Will you love me forever?

I couldn't take it any longer

Lord, I was crazed

And when the feeling came upon me

Like a tidal wave

I started (swearing to my god)

And on my (mother's) grave

That I would (love you to the end of time)

I swore I would (love you to the end of time)

Ah, ah, ah

So now I'm praying for the end of time

To hurry up and arrive

'Cause if I gotta spend another minute with you

I don't think that I can really survive

I'll never break my promise or forget my vow

(But God only knows what I can do right now)

I'm praying for the end of time

It's all that I can do {All that I can do}

Prayin' for the end of time

So I can end my time with you! {You, yeah}

It was long ago and it was far away (It never felt so good, It never felt so right)

And it was so much better than it is today {Better than it is today} (And we were glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife)

It was long ago and it was far away (It never felt so good, It never felt so right)

And it was so much better than it is today {Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah}

(And we were glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife)

It was long ago and it was far away (It never felt so good, It never felt so right)

And it was so much better than it is today

{Long ago, oh} (And we were glowing like the metal)

Felt so right

Felt so good

Paradise (Ooh, yeah)

# Because You Loved Me  

For all those times you stood by me

For all the truth that you made me see

For all the joy you brought to my life

For all the wrong that you made right

For every dream you made come true

For all the love I found in you

I'll be forever thankful, baby

You're the one who held me up

Never let me fall

You're the one who saw me through, through it all

You were my strength when I was weak

You were my voice when I couldn't speak

You were my eyes when I couldn't see

You saw the best there was in me

Lifted me up when I couldn't reach

You gave me faith 'cause you believed

I'm everything I am

Because you loved me

Ooh, baby

You gave me wings and made me fly

You touched my hand, I could touch the sky

I lost my faith, you gave it back to me

You said no star was out of reach

You stood by me and I stood tall

I had your love, I had it all

I'm grateful for each day you gave me

Maybe I don't know that much

But I know this much is true

I was blessed because I was loved by you

You were my strength when I was weak (You were my strength)

You were my voice when I couldn't speak

You were my eyes when I couldn't see

You saw the best there was in me

Lifted me up when I couldn't reach

You gave me faith 'cause you believed

I'm everything I am

Because you loved me (Loved me), oh

You were always there for me

The tender wind that carried me

A light in the dark, shining your love into my life

You've been my inspiration

Through the lies, you were the truth

My world is a better place because of you

You were my strength when I was weak (You were my strength)

You were my voice when I couldn't speak (Oh, when I couldn't speak)

You were my eyes when I couldn't see

You saw the best there was in me

Lifted me up when I couldn't reach (Oh)

You gave me faith 'cause you believed

I'm everything I am

Because you loved me (Hey)

You were my strength when I was weak

You were my voice when I couldn't speak (My voice)

You were my eyes when I couldn't see

You saw the best there was in me

Lifted me up when I couldn't reach (Oh)

You gave me faith 'cause you believed (Believed)

I'm everything I am

Because you loved me

Oh

I'm everything I am

Because you loved me

# It's All Coming Back To Me Now  

There were nights when the wind was so cold

That my body froze in bed if I just listened to it

Right outside the window

There were days when the sun was so cruel

That all the tears turned to dust

And I just knew my eyes were drying up forever (Forever)

I finished crying in the instant that you left

And I can't remember where or when or how

And I banished every memory you and I had ever made

But when you touch me like this

And you hold me like that

I just have to admit

That it's all coming back to me

When I touch you like this

And I hold you like that

It's so hard to believe

But it's all coming back to me

(It's all coming back, it's all coming back to me now)

There were moments of gold

And there were flashes of light

There were things I'd never do again

But then they'd always seemed right

There were nights of endless pleasure

It was more than any laws allow

Baby, baby

If I kiss you like this

And if you whisper like that

It was lost long ago

But it's all coming back to me

If you want me like this

And if you need me like that

It was dead long ago

But it's all coming back to me

It's so hard to resist

And it's all coming back to me

I can barely recall

But it's all coming back to me now

But it's all coming back

There were those empty threats and hollow lies

And whenever you tried to hurt me

I just hurt you even worse, and so much deeper

There were hours that just went on for days

When alone at last we'd count up all the chances

That were lost to us forever (Forever)

But you were history with the slamming of the door

And I made myself so strong again somehow

And I never wasted any of my time on you since then

But if I touch you like this

And if you kiss me like that

It was so long ago

But it's all coming back to me

If you touch me like this

And if I kiss you like that

It was gone with the wind

But it's all coming back to me

(It's all coming back, it's all coming back to me now)

There were moments of gold

And there were flashes of light

There were things we'd never do again

But then they'd always seemed right

There were nights of endless pleasure

It was more than all your laws allow

Baby, baby, baby

When you touch me like this

And when you hold me like that

It was gone with the wind

But it's all coming back to me

When you see me like this

And when I see you like that

Then we see what we want to see

All coming back to me

The flesh and the fantasies

All coming back to me

I can barely recall

But it's all coming back to me now

If you forgive me all this

If I forgive you all that

We forgive and forget

And it's all coming back to me

When you see me like this

And when I see you like that

We see just what we want to see

All coming back to me

The flesh and the fantasies

All coming back to me

I can barely recall

But it's all coming back to me now

(It's all coming back to me now)

And when you kiss me like this

(It's all coming back to me now)

And when I touch you like that

(It's all coming back to me now)

And if you do it like this

(It's all coming back to me now)

And if we

# I Was Here  

I wanna leave my footprints on the sands of time

Know there was something that meant something that I left behind

When I leave this world, I'll leave no regrets

Leave something to remember, so they won't forget

I was here

I lived, I loved

I was here

I did, I've done everything that I wanted

And it was more than I thought it would be

I will leave my mark so everyone will know

I was here

I wanna say I lived each day until I die

And know that I meant something in somebody's life

The hearts I have touched will be the proof that I leave

That I made a difference, and this world will see

I was here

I lived, I loved

I was here

I did, I've done everything that I wanted

And it was more than I thought it would be

I will leave my mark so everyone will know

I was here

I lived, I loved

I was here

I did, I've done everything that I wanted

And it was more than I thought it would be

I will leave my mark so everyone will know

I was here

I just want them to know

That I gave my all, did my best

Brought someone some happiness

Left this world a little better just because

I was here

I was here

I lived, I loved

I was here

I did, I've done everything that I wanted

And it was more than I thought it would be

I wanna leave my mark so everyone will know

I was here

(Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na)

I lived (I lived), I loved

(Na-na-na-na, na-na-na)

I was here

I did (I did), I've done

I lived (I lived), I loved (I loved)

(Na-na-na-na, na-na-na)

I was here (Oh)

(Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na)

I did, I've done

(Na-na-na-na, na-na-na)

I was here

# So Emotional  

I don't know why I like it, huh

I just do

Woo, ooh

Ooh

I've been hearin' your heartbeat inside of me

I keep your photo right beside my bed

Livin' in a world of fantasies

I can't get you out of my head, uh

I've been waiting for the phone to ring all night

Why you wanna make me feel so good?

I got a love of my own, babe

I shouldn't get so hung up on you

I remember the way that we touched

I wish I didn't like it so much

Ah, uh

I get so emotional, baby

Every time I think of you

I get so emotional, baby

Ain't it shocking what love can do?

Ain't it shocking what love can do?

Ain't it shocking what love can do? Hee

I gotta watch you walk in the room, baby

I gotta watch you walk out, yes, I do

I like the animal way you move

And when you talk, I just watch your mouth

Oh, I remember the way that we touched

I wish I didn't like it so much

Ooh

I get so emotional, baby

Every time I think of you

I get so emotional, baby

Ain't it shocking what love can do?

I get so emotional, baby

Every time I think of you

I get so emotional, baby

Ain't it shocking what love can do?

Ain't it shocking what love can do?

Ain't it shocking, love can do

Hee-hee

Can you work on me? Work on me

Haha

I wish I didn't like it so much

No, no, no

Every time I think of you

Ain't it shocking what love can do? You know what it does

Every time I think of you (You know what I mean, hee, hee, hoo)

I get so emotional, baby (Hey, yeah, baby)

Shocking what love can do, ooh-ooh

# Cell Block Tango  

And now, the six merry murderesses of the Cook County Jail

In their rendition of 'The Cell Block Tango'!

Pop! Six! Squish! Uh uh! Cicero, Lipschitz!

Pop! Six! Squish! Uh uh! Cicero, Lipschitz!

Pop! Six! Squish! Uh uh! Cicero, Lipschitz!

Pop! Six! Squish! Uh uh! Cicero, Lipschitz!

He had it comin', he had it comin'

He only had himself to blame!

If you'd have been there, if you'd have seen it

I betcha you would have done the same!

Pop! Six! Squish! Uh uh! Cicero, Lipschitz!

You know how people have these little habits that get you down? Like Bernie! Bernie liked to chew gum--no, not chew. Pop!

Well, I come home this one day, and there's Bernie, layin' on the couch, chewin'--no, not chewin', poppin'!

So, I said to him, I said "Bernie, you pop that gum one more time…"

And he did. So I took the shotgun off the wall and I fired two warning shots

Into his head!

He had it comin', he had it comin'

He only had himself to blame!

I met Ezekiel Young from Salt Lake City about two years ago and he told me he was single and we uh, hit it off right away. So, we started livin' together. He'd go to work, he'd come home, I'd mix him a drink, we'd have dinner

Then I found out, single my ass! Not only was he married, well, he had six wives; one of them Mormons, you know?

So that night, when he came home, I mixed him his drink as usual

You know, some guys just can't hold their arsenic!

He had it comin', he had it comin' (Pop! Six! Squish! Uh-huh! Cicero, Lipschitz!)

He took a flower in its prime! (Pop! Six! Squish! Uh-huh! Cicero, Lipschitz!)

And then he used it (Pop!); and he abused it (Six!)

It was a murder, but not a crime! (Squish! Uh uh! Cicero, Lipschitz!)

Now, I'm standin' in the kitchen, carvin' up the chicken for dinner, and in storms my husband Wilbur in a jealous rage

"You been screwin' the milkman!" he said, and he kept sayin', "You been screwin' the milkman!"

Then he ran into my knife.

He ran into my knife ten times

If you'd have been there, if you'd have seen it

I betcha you would have done the same!

Mit keresek én itt? Azt mondják, a híres lakóm lefogta a férjem, én meg lecsaptam a fejét. De nem igaz. Én ártatlan vagyok. Nem tudom, miért mondja Uncle Sam, hogy én tettem. Próbáltam a rendőrségen megmagyarázni, de nem értették meg

But did you do it?

Uh uh, not guilty!

(He had it comin')

My sister Veronica and I did this double act (He had it comin')

And my husband Charlie traveled around with us. For the last number in our act, we did these twenty acrobatic tricks in a row (He only had himself to blame)

One, two, three, four, five, splits, spread eagles, flip flops, backflips, one right after the other! (If you'd have been there)

Well, this one night we were in Cicero, the three of us (If you'd have seen it)

And we were in this hotel room boozin' and havin' a few laughs. And we run out of ice, so I went out to get some (I betcha you would have done the same)

I come back, open the door…

There's Veronica and Charlie doin' number seventeen… the spread eagle! (He had it comin', he had it—)

Well, I was in such a state of shock, I completely blacked out. I can't remember a thing. It wasn't until later, when I was washin' the blood off my hands, I even knew they were dead!

They had it comin' (They had it comin'!), they had it comin'! (They had it comin'!)

They had it comin' all along! (They took a flower in its prime)

I didn't do it (And then they used it), but if I'd done it (And they abused it)

How could you tell me that I was wrong? (It was a murder, but not a crime)

(He had it comin')

I loved Alvin Lipschitz

He was a real artistic guy, sensitive, a painter (He had it comin')

But he was always trying to "find himself". He'd go out every night looking for himself (He only had himself to blame)

And on the way, he found Ruth, Gladys, Rosemary and Irving (If you'd have been there)

I guess you can say we broke up because of artistic differences (If you'd have seen it)

He saw himself as alive

And I saw him dead

The dirty bum, bum, bum, bum, bum!

The dirty bum, bum, bum, bum, bum!

They had it comin' (They had it comin'), they had it comin' (They had it comin')

They had it comin' all along! (They had it comin' all along)

'Cause if they used us ('Cause if they used us), and they abused us (And they abused us)

How could they tell us that we were wrong?

He had it comin' (He had it comin'), he had it comin' (He had it comin')

He only had himself to blame! (He only had himself to blame)

If you'd have been there (If you'd have been there), if you'd have seen it (If you'd have seen it)

I betcha you would have done the same

You pop that gum one more time--

Single my ass--

Ten times--

Miért csukott Uncle Sam börtönbe!

Number seventeen, the spread eagle!

Artistic differences—

I betcha you would have done the same!

# Take My Breath Away  

Watching every motion in my foolish lover's game

On this endless ocean, finally lovers know no shame

Turning and returning to some secret place inside

Watching in slow motion as you turn around and say

"Take my breath away"

"Take my breath away"

Watching, I keep waiting, still anticipating love

Never hesitating to become the fated ones

Turning and returning to some secret place to hide

Watching in slow motion as you turn to me and say

"My love, take my breath away"

Through the hourglass, I saw you

In time, you slipped away

When the mirror crashed I called you

And turned to hear you say

"If only for today, I am unafraid"

"Take my breath away"

"Take my breath away"

Watching every motion in this foolish lover's game

Haunted by the notion somewhere there's a love in flames

Turning and returning to some secret place inside

Watching in slow motion as you turn my way and say

"Take my breath away"

"My love, take my breath away"

"My love, take my breath away, my love"

"My love, take my breath away, my love"

"Take my breath away..."

# Home  

Another summer day has come and gone away

In Paris and Rome, but I wanna go home, mmm

Maybe surrounded by a million people, I

Still feel all alone

I just wanna go home

Oh, I miss you, you know

And I've been keeping all the letters that I wrote to you

Each one a line or two

"I'm fine, baby, how are you?"

Well, I would send them, but I know that it's just not enough

My words were cold and flat

And you deserve more than that

Another aeroplane, another sunny place

I'm lucky, I know, but I wanna go home

Mmm, I got to go home

Let me go home

I'm just too far from where you are

I wanna come home

And I feel just like I'm living someone else's life

It's like I just stepped outside

When everything was going right

And I know just why you could not come along with me

That this was not your dream

But you always believed in me

Another winter day has come and gone away

In either Paris or Rome, and I wanna go home

Let me go home

And I'm surrounded by a million people, I

I still feel alone

Oh, let me go home

Oh, I miss you, you know

Let me go home

I've had my run and baby, I'm done

I gotta go home

Let me go home

It'll all be alright

I'll be home tonight

I'm coming back home

# How Will I Know  

There's a boy I know, he's the one I dream of

Looks into my eyes, takes me to the clouds above

Ooh, I lose control, can't seem to get enough, uh-huh

When I wake from dreaming, tell me, is it really love?

Ooh, how will I know? (Don't trust your feelings)

How will I know?

How will I know? (Love can be deceiving)

How will I know?

How will I know if he really loves me?

I say a prayer with every heartbeat

I fall in love whenever we meet

I'm asking you 'cause you know about these things

How will I know if he's thinking of me?

I try to phone, but I'm too shy (Can't speak)

Falling in love is so bittersweet

This love is strong, why do I feel weak?

Oh, wake me, I'm shaking

Wish I had you near me now, uh-huh

Said there's no mistakin'

What I feel is really love

Ooh, tell me

How will I know? (Don't trust your feelings)

How will I know?

How will I know? (Love can be deceiving)

How will I know?

How will I know if he really loves me?

I say a prayer with every heartbeat

I fall in love whenever we meet

I'm asking you 'cause you know about these things

How will I know if he's thinking of me?

I try to phone, but I'm too shy (Can't speak)

Falling in love is so bittersweet

This love is strong, why do I feel weak?

If he loves me

If he loves me not (Mm)

If he loves me

(Ooh) If he loves me not

(Hey) If he loves me

If he loves me not

Oh, how will I know?

How will I know?

How will I know?

Hey, how will I know? (Ooh)

Falling in love is so bittersweet

This love is strong, why do I feel weak?

How will I know? (How will I know?)

How will I know?

How will I know? (I say a prayer)

How will I know? Ooh

How will I know? (I fall in love)

How will I know?

Hey, how will I know?

I'm asking you

How will I, how will I know?

# Fighter  

Hm

After all you put me through

You'd think I'd despise you (Ooh)

But in the end, I wanna thank you

'Cause you made me that much stronger

Well, I, I thought I knew you

Thinkin' that you were true

Guess I, I couldn't trust, called your bluff

Time is up 'cause I've had enough

You were there by my side

Always down for the ride

But your joy ride just came down in flames

'Cause your greed sold me out in shame, mhm

After all of the stealing and cheating

You probably think that I hold resentment for you

But uh-uh, oh no, you're wrong

'Cause if it wasn't for all that you tried to do

I wouldn't know just how capable

I am to pull through

So I wanna say thank you, 'cause it

Makes me that much stronger

Makes me work a little bit harder

Makes me that much wiser

So thanks for making me a fighter

Made me learn a little bit faster

Made my skin a little bit thicker

Makes me that much smarter

So thanks for making me a fighter

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, yeah, yeah, oh

Never saw it coming

All of your backstabbing

Just so you could cash in on a good thing

Before I realized your game

I heard you're goin' 'round

Playin' the victim now

But don't even begin feeling I'm the one to blame

'Cause you dug your own grave

After all of the fights and the lies

Guess you're wanting to hold me

But that won't work anymore (No more, uh-huh, it's over)

'Cause if it wasn't for all of your torture

I wouldn't know how to be this way now and never back down

So I wanna say thank you, 'cause it

Makes me that much stronger

Makes me work a little bit harder

It makes me that much wiser

So thanks for making me a fighter

Made me learn a little bit faster

Made my skin a little bit thicker

Makes me that much smarter

So thanks for making me a fighter

How could this man I thought I knew

Turn out to be unjust, so cruel?

Could only see the good in you

Pretended not to see the truth

You tried to hide your lies, disguise yourself

Through living in denial

But in the end you'll see, you won't stop me

I am a fighter and I (I'm a fighter)

I ain't gon' stop (I ain't gonna stop)

There is no turning back

I've had enough

Makes me that much stronger

Makes me work a little bit harder (Oh)

It makes me that much wiser (Ooh yeah, ooh yeah)

So thanks for making me a fighter (Ha, a fighter)

Made me learn a little bit faster (Yeah)

Made my skin a little bit thicker (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Makes me that much smarter (Yeah)

So thanks for making me a fighter (Fighter)

You thought I would forget, thought I, I remember (Oh)

'Cause I remember (Oh)

I remember

You thought I would forget (Ooh-ooh)

I remember (Oh-ooh)

'Cause I remember (Oh)

I remember

Makes me that much stronger (Ooh-ooh)

Makes me work a little bit harder (Ooh-ooh)

It makes me that much wiser

So thanks for making me a fighter

Made me learn a little bit faster

Made my skin a little bit thicker

It makes me that much smarter

So thanks for making me a fighter

# Fly / I Believe I Can Fly  

I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive

I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise

To fly

To fly (Uh, yo, yo)

I used to think that I could not go on

I wish today it would rain all day

Maybe that will kinda make the pain go away

And life was nothing but an awful song

They got their guns out aiming at me

But I become Neo when they aiming at me (If I can see it)

Me, me, me against them

Me against enemies, me against friends (Then I can do it)

Somehow they both seem to become one

A sea full of sharks and they all smell blood (If I just believe it)

They start coming and I start rising

Must be surprising, I'm just surmising (There's nothing to it)

I win, thrive, soar

Higher, higher, higher

More fire

(I came to win), to fight, to conquer, to thrive

I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise

I believe I can fly (Fly)

I believe I can touch the sky

I believe I can fly (Fly)

I believe I can touch the sky

See, I was on the verge of breaking down

Paint they own pictures, then they crop me in

But I will remain where the top begins

Sometimes silence can seem so loud

I am not a word, I am not a line

I am not a girl that can ever be defined (If I can see it)

I hear the criticism loud and clear

That is how I know that the time is near (Then I can do it)

See we become alive in a time of fear

And I ain't got no motherfickle time to spare (If I just believe it)

Cry my eyes out for days upon days

Such a heavy burden placed upon me (There's nothing to it)

But when you go hard your nays become yays

Yankee Stadium with Jay's and Kanye's

(I came to win), to fight, to conquer, to thrive

I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise

I believe I can fly (Fly) {Fly}

I believe I can touch the sky {Ooh-ooh, uh, yeah}

I believe I can fly (Fly)

I believe I can touch the sky {Fly}

I believe I can fly (Fly)

(Get ready for it, get ready for it) Then I can be it

(Get ready for it, I came to win) If I just believe it

(Get ready for it, get ready for it) There's nothing to it

Get ready for it

I believe I can fly (Fly) {Ooh-ooh}

I believe I can touch the sky {Fly}

I think about it every night and day (Fly) {Oh}

Spread my wings and fly away {Ooh, whoa}

(I can fly) I believe I can soar (Fly) {Get ready for it}

(I can fly) I see me runnin' through that open door {Get ready for it, fly}

{I can fly} I believe I can fly (Fly) (Woo) (Get ready for it)

(New Directions: I can fly) I believe I can fly

I believe I can (Fly)

# Don't Speak  

You and me

We used to be together

Every day together, always

I really feel

That I'm losing my best friend

I can't believe this could be the end

It looks as though you're letting go

And if it's real, well, I don't want to know

Don't speak

I know just what you're sayin'

So please stop explainin'

Don't tell me 'cause it hurts

Don't speak

I know what you're thinkin'

I don't need your reasons

Don't tell me 'cause it hurts

Our memories

They can be inviting

But some are altogether mighty frightening

As we die, both you and I

With my head in my hands, I sit and cry

Don't speak

I know just what you're sayin'

So please stop explainin'

Don't tell me 'cause it hurts

No, no, no, don't speak

I know what you're thinkin'

And I don't need your reasons

Don't tell me 'cause it hurts

It's all ending

I gotta stop pretending

Who we are

You and me

I can see us dyin'

Are we?

Don't speak

I know just what you're sayin'

So please stop explainin'

Don't tell me 'cause it hurts

No, no, don't speak

I know what you're thinkin'

And I don't need your reasons

Don't tell me 'cause it hurts

Don't tell me 'cause it hurts

I know what you're sayin'

So please stop explainin'

Don't speak, don't speak

Don't speak, no

I know what you're thinkin'

And I don't need your reasons

I know you're good

I know you're good

I know you're real good, oh

La-la-la-la

La-la-la-la

Don't, don't

Ooh-ooh

Hush, hush, darlin'

Hush, hush, darlin'

Hush, hush

Don't tell me 'cause it hurts

Hush, hush, darlin'

Hush, hush, darlin'

Hush, hush

Don't tell me 'cause it hurts

Oh, hush, hush, darlin'

Hush, hush, darlin'

# Thank You  

My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I

Got out of bed at all

The morning rain clouds up my window

And I can't see at all

And even if I could, it'd all be grey

But your picture on my wall

It reminds me that it's not so bad

It's not so bad

I drank too much last night, got bills to pay

My head just feels in pain

I missed the bus and there'll be hell today

I'm late for work again

And even if I'm there, they'll all imply

That I might not last the day

And then you call me and it's not so bad

It's not so bad

And I want to thank you

For giving me the best day of my life

And oh, just to be with you

Is having the best day of my life

Push the door, I'm home at last

And I'm soaking through and through

And then you handed me a towel

And all I see is you

And even if my house falls down now

I wouldn't have a clue

Because you're near me

And I want to thank you

For giving me the best day of my life

And oh, just to be with you

Is having the best day of my life

And I want to thank you

For giving me the best day of my life

And oh, just to be with you

Is having the best day of my life

# Mean  

You, with your words like knives

And swords and weapons that you use against me

You, have knocked me off my feet again

Got me feeling like I'm nothing

You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard

Calling me out when I'm wounded

You, pickin' on the weaker man

Well you can take me down

With just one single blow

But you don't know, what you don't know

Someday, I'll be living in a big old city

And all you're ever gonna be is mean

Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me

And all you're ever gonna be is mean

Why you gotta be so mean?

You, with your switching sides

And your wildfire lies and your humiliation

You, have pointed out my flaws again

As if I don't already see them

I walk with my head down

Trying to block you out

'Cause I'll never impress you

I just wanna feel okay again

I bet you got pushed around

Somebody made you cold

But the cycle ends right now

Cause you can't lead me down that road

You don't know, what you don't know

Someday, I'll be, living in a big old city

And all you're ever gonna be is mean

Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me

And all you're ever gonna be is mean

Why you gotta be so mean?

And I can see you years from now in a bar

Talking over a football game

With that same big loud opinion but

Nobody's listening

Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things

Drunk and grumbling on about how I can't sing

But all you are is mean

All you are is mean

And a liar, and pathetic, and alone in life, and mean

And mean, and mean, and mean

But someday, I'll be, living in a big old city

And all you're ever gonna be is mean. Yeah

Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me

And all you're ever gonna be is mean

Why you gotta be so mean? (Someday, I'll be, living in a big old city)

Why you gotta be so mean? (And all you're ever gonna be is mean)

Why you gotta be so mean? (Someday, I'll be living in a big old city)

Why you gotta be so mean?

And all you're ever gonna be is mean

Why you gotta be so mean?

# Hurt  

Seems like it was yesterday when I saw your face

You told me how proud you were, but I walked away

If only I knew what I know today

Ooh, ooh

I would hold you in my arms

I would take the pain away

Thank you for all you've done

Forgive all your mistakes

There's nothing I wouldn't do

To hear your voice again

Sometimes I wanna call you

But I know you won't be there

Oh, I'm sorry for blaming you

For everything I just couldn't do

And I've hurt myself by hurting you

Some days I feel broke inside, but I won't admit

Sometimes I just wanna hide 'cause it's you I miss

And it's so hard to say goodbye when it comes to this

Ooh, ooh, ah

Would you tell me I was wrong?

Would you help me understand?

Are you lookin' down upon me?

Are you proud of who I am?

There's nothing I wouldn't do

To have just one more chance

To look into your eyes

And see you looking back

Oh, I'm sorry for blaming you

For everything I just couldn't do

And I've hurt myself

Oh, oh

If I had just one more day

I would tell you how much that I've missed you since you've been away

Oh, it's dangerous

It's so out of line

To try and turn back time

I'm sorry for blaming you

For everything I just couldn't do

And I've hurt myself

By hurting you

# The Code  

Woah-oh-oh

Welcome to the show, let everybody know

I'm done playin' the game, I'll break out of the chains

You better buckle up, I'll pour another cup

This is my bohème, so drink it up, my friend

Oh

Oh

This story is my truth

I, I went to hell and back

To find myself on track

I broke the code, woah-oh-oh

Like ammonites

I just gave it some time

Now I found paradise

I broke the code, woah-oh-oh (Yeah)

Let me tell you a tale about life

'Bout the good and the bad, better hold on tight

Who decides what's wrong, what's right?

Everything is balance, everything's light

I got so much on my mind

And I been awake all night

I'm so pumped, I'm so psyched

It's bigger than me, I'm gettin' so hyped, like

(Oh) Let me taste the lows and highs

(Oh) Let me feel that burning fright

(Oh) This story is my truth

I, I went to hell and back

To find myself on track

I broke the code, woah-oh-oh

Like ammonites

I just gave it some time

Now I found paradise

I broke the code, woah-oh-oh (Ooh)

Somewhere between the O's and ones

That's where I found my kingdom come

My heart beats like a—

Somewhere between the O's and ones

That's where I found my kingdom come

My heart beats like a drum

(Ooh, ooh-ooh)

(Ooh, ooh)

(Ooh, ooh)

I, I went to hell and back

To find myself on track

I broke the code, woah-oh-oh

Like ammonites

I just gave it some time

Now I found paradise

I broke the code, woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh

# Listen to Your Heart  

I know there's something in the wake of your smile

I get a notion from the look in your eyes, yeah

You've built a love, but that love falls apart

Your little piece of Heaven turns too dark

Listen to your heart

When he's calling for you

Listen to your heart

There's nothing else you can do

I don't know where you're going

And I don't know why

But listen to your heart

Before you tell him goodbye

Sometimes you wonder if this fight is worthwhile

The precious moments are all lost in the tide, yeah

They're swept away, and nothing is what is seems

The feeling of belonging to your dreams

Listen to your heart

When he's calling for you

Listen to your heart

There's nothing else you can do

I don't know where you're going

And I don't know why

But listen to your heart

Before you tell him goodbye

And there are voices that want to be heard

So much to mention but you can't find the words

The scent of magic, the beauty that's been

When love was wilder than the wind

Listen to your heart (Take a listen to it)

When he's calling for you

Listen to your heart (Take a listen to it)

There's nothing else you can do

I don't know where you're going

And I don't know why

But listen to your heart before, uhh

Listen to your heart (Take a listen to it)

When he's calling for you

Listen to your heart (Take a listen to it)

There's nothing else you can do

I don't know where you're going

And I don't know why

But listen to your heart

Before you tell him goodbye

Listen to your heart

Listen to your heart (Uhh, take a listen to it, ha-ha-aa)

Listen to your heart (Take a, take a listen to it)

Listen to your heart

Listen to your heart

Listen to your heart

Listen to your heart

Listen to your heart

Listen to your heart

Listen to your heart

Listen to your heart

# The Reason  

I'm not a perfect person

There's many things I wish I didn't do

But I continue learning

I never meant to do those things to you

And so I have to say before I go

That I just want you to know

I've found a reason for me

To change who I used to be

A reason to start over new

And the reason is you

I'm sorry that I hurt you

It's something I must live with every day

And all the pain I put you through

I wish that I could take it all away

And be the one who catches all your tears

That's why I need you to hear

I've found a reason for me

To change who I used to be

A reason to start over new

And the reason is you

And the reason is you

And the reason is you

And the reason is you

I'm not a perfect person

I never meant to do those things to you

And so I have to say before I go

That I just want you to know

I've found a reason for me

To change who I used to be

A reason to start over new

And the reason is you

I've found a reason to show

A side of me you didn't know

A reason for all that I do

And the reason is you

# Rolling in the Deep  

There's a fire starting in my heart

Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark

Finally, I can see you crystal clear

Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare

See how I'll leave with every piece of you

Don't underestimate the things that I will do

There's a fire starting in my heart

Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark

The scars of your love remind me of us

They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all

The scars of your love, they leave me breathless

I can't help feeling

We could've had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me)

Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you never had met me)

And you played it to the beat (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Baby, I have no story to be told

But I've heard one on you, now I'm gonna make your head burn

Think of me in the depths of your despair

Make a home down there, as mine sure won't be shared

(You're gonna wish you never had met me) The scars of your love remind me of us

(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all

(You're gonna wish you never had met me) The scars of your love, they leave me breathless

(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) I can't help feeling

We could've had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me)

Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you never had met me)

And you played it to the beat (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Could've had it all

Rolling in the deep

You had my heart inside of your hand

But you played it with a beating

Throw your soul through every open door (Ooh woah, oh)

Count your blessings to find what you look for (Woah)

Turn my sorrow into treasured gold (Ooh woah, oh)

You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you've sown

(You're gonna wish you never had met me)

We could've had it all (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

We could've had it all, yeah (You're gonna wish you never had met me)

It all, it all, it all (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

We could've had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me)

Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you never had met me)

And you played it to the beat (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Could've had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me)

Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you never had met me)

But you played it, you played it, you played it

You played it to the beat

# Cry  

If anyone asks

I'll tell them we both just moved on

When people all stare

I'll pretend that I don't hear them talk

Whenever I see you

I'll swallow my pride

And bite my tongue

Pretend I'm okay with it all

Act like there's nothing wrong

Is it over yet?

Can I open my eyes?

Is this as hard as it gets?

Is this what it feels like to really cry?

Cry!

If anyone asks

I'll tell them we just grew apart (Tell them we just grew apart)

And what do I care

If they believe me or not (They believe me or not)

Whenever I feel

Your memory is breaking my heart

I'll pretend I'm okay with it all

Act like there's nothing wrong

Is it over yet?

Can I open my eyes?

Is this as hard as it gets?

Is this what it feels like to really cry?

Cry!

I'm talking in circles

I'm lying, they know it

Why won't this just all go...

...Away!

Is it over yet?

Can I open my eyes?

Is this as hard as it gets?

Is this what it feels like to really cry?

Cry!

Cry!

# Shallow  

Tell me somethin', girl

Are you happy in this modern world?

Or do you need more?

Is there somethin' else you're searchin' for?

I'm fallin'

In all the good times, I find myself longin'

For change

And, in the bad times, I fear myself

Tell me something, boy

Aren't you tired tryna fill that void?

Or do you need more?

Ain't it hard keepin' it so hardcore?

I'm falling

In all the good times, I find myself longing

For change

And, in the bad times, I fear myself

I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in

I'll never meet the ground

Crash through the surface where they can't hurt us

We're far from the shallow now

In the sha-ha, sha-hallow

In the sha-ha, sha-la-la-la-low

In the sha-ha, sha-hallow

We're far from the shallow now

Oh, ha, ah, ha

Oh-ah, ha

I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in

I'll never meet the ground

Crash through the surface where they can't hurt us

We're far from the shallow now

In the sha-ha, shallow

In the sha-ha, sha-la-la-la-low

In the sha-ha, shallow

We're far from the shallow now

# OWN MY MIND  

Well, I don't know your secrets, I'm no visionary

Yeah, I don't know your story but I like what I see

So, tell me what you've been missing

I'll do anything to get you ticking

And you might be the answer to the sinner in me

Oh, it's automatic

You know I just gotta have it

I'll make your body a habit

You know there's some kind of magic, uh-huh

And do you wanna, do you wanna own my mind, own my mind?

Do you wanna, do you wanna all the time, all the time?

Do you wanna know what the good good bad things all feel like?

Yeah, do you wanna, do you wanna own my mind, own my mind?

Own my mind, own my mind

Own my mind, own my mind

Do you wanna know what the good good bad things all feel like?

Do you wanna, do you wanna own my mind, own my mind?

In my civilization, you're the king and the queen

I'm prayin' at your altar if you know what I mean

Yeah, everything I've been missin'

You've been servin' up in your kitchen

No, I'm not even superstitious

But I'm feelin' you're something vicious, yeah

It's automatic

You know I just gotta have it

I'll make your body a habit

You know there's some kind of magic, uh-huh

And do you wanna, do you wanna own my mind, own my mind?

Do you wanna, do you wanna all the time, all the time?

Do you wanna know what the good good bad things all feel like?

Own my mind, own my mind

Own my mind, own my mind

Do you wanna know what the good good bad things all feel like?

Do you wanna, do you wanna own my mind, own my mind?

Do you want a long night?

Do you wanna be mine?

Do you wanna go once, go twice? Girl

Do you want a long night?

Do you wanna be mine?

Do you wanna go once, go twice? Girl

Do you wanna, do you wanna own my mind, own my mind?

Do you wanna, do you wanna own my mind, own my mind?

# Mystery of Love  

Oh, to see without my eyes

The first time that you kissed me

Boundless by the time I cried

I built your walls around me

White noise, what an awful sound

Fumbling by Rogue River

Feel my feet above the ground

Hand of God, deliver me

Oh, oh woe-oh-woah is me

The first time that you touched me

Oh, will wonders ever cease?

Blessed be the mystery of love

Lord, I no longer believe

Drowned in living waters

Cursed by the love that I received

From my brother's daughter

Like Hephaestion, who died

Alexander's lover

Now my riverbed has dried

Shall I find no other?

Oh, oh woe-oh-woah is me

I'm running like a plover

Now I'm prone to misery

The birthmark on your shoulder reminds me

How much sorrow can I take?

Blackbird on my shoulder

And what difference does it make

When this love is over?

Shall I sleep within your bed?

River of unhappiness

Hold your hands upon my head

Till I breathe my last breath

Oh, oh woe-oh-woah is me

The last time that you touched me

Oh, will wonders ever cease?

Blessed be the mystery of love

# Futile Devices  

It's been a long, long time since I've memorized your face

It's been four hours now since I've wandered through your place

And when I sleep on your couch, I feel very safe

And when you bring the blankets, I cover up my face

I do love you

I do, ooh-ooh, love you

And when you play guitar, I listen to the strings buzz

The metal vibrates underneath your fingers

And when you crochet, I feel mesmerized and proud

And I would say I love you, but saying it out loud is hard

So I won't say it at all

And I won't stay very long

But you are the life I needed all along

I think of you as my brother

Although that sounds dumb

And words are futile devices

# Visions of Gideon  

I have loved you for the last time

Is it a video? Is it a video?

I have touched you for the last time

Is it a video? Is it a video?

For the love, for laughter, I flew up to your arms

Is it a video? Is it a video?

For the love, for laughter, I flew up to your arms

Is it a video? Is it a video?

Is it a video?

I have loved you for the last time

Visions of Gideon, visions of Gideon

And I have kissed you for the last time

Visions of Gideon, visions of Gideon

For the love, for laughter, I flew up to your arms

Is it a video? (Is it a video?) Is it a video? (Is it a video?)

For the love, for laughter, I flew up to your arms

Is it a video? (Is it a video?) Is it a video? (Is it a video?)

For the love, for laughter, I flew up to your arms

Visions of Gideon, (visions of Gideon), visions of Gideon, (visions of Gideon)

For the love, for laughter, I flew up to your arms

Visions of Gideon, (visions of Gideon), visions of Gideon, (visions of Gideon), Visions of Gideon

Visions of Gideon, visions of Gideon, visions of Gideon

Visions of Gideon, visions of Gideon, visions of Gideon

Visions of Gideon, (Is it a video?), visions of Gideon, (Is it a video?), visions of Gideon

Visions of Gideon, (Is it a video?), visions of Gideon, (Is it a video?), visions of Gideon

# Encostar na Tua  

Eu quero te roubar pra mim

Eu, que não sei pedir nada

Meu caminho é meio perdido

Mas que perder seja o melhor destino

Agora não vou mais mudar

Minha procura por si só

Já era o que eu queria achar

Quando você chamar meu nome

Eu, que também não sei aonde estou

Pra mim que tudo era saudade

Agora seja lá o que for...

Eu só quero saber em qual rua

Minha vida vai encostar na tua...

Eu só quero saber em qual rua

Minha vida vai encostar na tua...

Eu quero te roubar pra mim

Eu, que não sei pedir nada

Meu caminho é meio perdido

Mas que perder seja o melhor destino

Agora não vou mais mudar

Minha procura por si só

Já era o que eu queria achar

Quando você chamar meu nome

Eu, que também não sei aonde estou

Pra mim que tudo era saudade

Agora seja lá o que for...

Eu só quero saber em qual rua

Minha vida vai encostar na tua...

Eu só quero saber em qual rua

Minha vida vai encostar na tua...

E saiba que forte eu sei chegar

Mesmo se eu perder o rumo, yeah!

E saiba que forte eu sei chegar

Se for preciso eu sumo...

Eu só quero saber em qual rua

Minha vida vai encostar na tua...

Eu só quero saber em qual rua

Minha vida vai encostar na tua...

Eu quero te roubar pra mim...

# Você me faz tão bem  

Quando eu me perco é quando eu te encontro

Quando eu me solto seus olhos me veem

Quando eu me iludo é quando eu te esqueço

Quando eu te tenho eu me sinto tão bem

Você me fez sentir de novo o que eu

Já não me importava mais

Você me faz tão bem

Você me faz, você me faz tão bem

Quando eu te invado de silêncio

Você conforta a minha dor com atenção

E quando eu durmo no seu colo

Você me faz sentir de novo

O que eu já não sentia mais

Você me faz tão bem

Você me faz, você me faz tão bem

Você me faz, você me faz tão bem

Você me faz, você me faz tão bem

Não tenha medo

Não tenha medo desse amor

Não faz sentido

Não faz sentido não mudar

Esse amor

Você me faz, você me faz tão bem

Você me faz, você me faz tão bem

Você me faz, você me faz tão bem

Você me faz, você me faz tão bem

# Outro Lugar  

'Inda vou te levar pra outro lugar

Além do sol, do mar

Aonde eu possa te ter, te amar

E o tempo vai ser maior

Não te quero assim tão longe

Tanto, quanto o céu do mar

Quero ter você mais perto

Certo, pronto pra te amar

'Inda vou te levar pra outro lugar

Além do sol, do mar

Aonde eu possa te ter, te amar

E o tempo vai ser maior

Quero ter o teu encanto

Tanto, pra me enfeitiçar

Quero ter você mais... perto

Pra poder te amar

Eu podia até tentar acreditar nessa ilusão

Não sei porquê, viagem errada então

O meu caminho me levava a acreditar que eu tava certo

Que eu era esperto e coisa e tal

Cara sinistro da zona sul

Andando com um monte de santinha pra lá e pra cá

Mas com você foi diferente, foi de primeira, quando eu te vi até me faltou ar

As oportunidades desta vida me fazem crer

Que quando estamos frente a frente, só eu e você

O tempo passa, tudo é mais fácil

Difícil é esquecer o que eu faço quando você se vai

Eu fico aqui bolando planos mirabolantes

Fico inconstante, pareço iniciante

Eu vou fazer de tudo pra trazer você pra perto de mim

Pode acreditar que sim

'Inda vou te levar pra outro lugar

Além do sol, do mar

Aonde eu possa te ter, te amar

E o tempo vai ser maior

'Inda vou te levar pra outro lugar

Além do sol, do mar

Aonde eu possa te ter, te amar

E o tempo vai ser maior

# Sutilmente  

E quando eu estiver triste

Simplesmente me abrace

Quando eu estiver louco

Subitamente se afaste

Quando eu estiver fogo

Suavemente se encaixe

E quando eu estiver triste

Simplesmente me abrace

E quando eu estiver louco

Subitamente se afaste

E quando eu estiver bobo

Sutilmente disfarce

Mas quando eu estiver morto

Suplico que não me mate, não

Dentro de ti, dentro de ti

Mesmo que o mundo acabe, enfim

Dentro de tudo que cabe em ti

# Resposta  

Bem mais que o tempo

Que nós perdemos

Ficou pra trás também o que nos juntou

Ainda lembro o que eu estava lendo

Só pra saber o que você achou

Dos versos que eu fiz

E ainda espero resposta

Desfaz o vento

O que há por dentro

Desse lugar que ninguém mais pisou

Você está vendo o que está acontecendo

Nesse caderno sei que ainda estão

Os versos seus

Tão meus que peço

Nos versos meus

Tão seus que esperem

Que os aceite

Em paz

Eu digo que eu sou

O antigo do que vai

Adiante

Sem mais eu fico onde estou

Prefiro continuar distante

# Outra Vida  

Talvez não seja nessa vida ainda

Mas você ainda vai ser a minha vida

Então, a gente vai fugir pro mar

Eu vou pedir pra namorar

Você vai me dizer que vai pensar

Mas, no fim, vai beijar

Talvez não seja nessa vida ainda

Mas você ainda vai ser a minha vida

Sem ter mais mentiras pra me ver

Sem amor antigo pra esquecer

Sem os teus amigos pra esconder

Pode crer que tudo vai dar certo

Uebaruê-iô

Sou pescador, sonhador

Vou dizer pra Deus, nosso Senhor

Que tu és o amor da minha vida

Pois não dá pra viver nessa vida morendo de amor, o-iô

Talvez não seja nessa vida ainda

Mas você ainda vai ser a minha vida

E uma abelinha vai fazer o mel

Estrela d'alva vai pintar o céu

O vento certo vai soprar no mar

E pode crer que tudo vai dar certo

Sou pescador, sonhador

Vou dizer pra Deus, nosso Senhor

Que tu és o amor da minha vida

Pois não dá pra viver nessa vida morendo de amor

# Tô nem aí  

De mãos atadas, de pés descalços

Com você meu mundo andava de pernas pro ar

Sempre armada, segui seus passos

Atei seus braços pra você não me abandonar

Já nem lembro seu nome

Seu telefone eu fiz questão de apagar

Aceitei os meus erros, me reinventei e virei a página

Agora eu tô em outra

Tô nem aí, tô nem aí

Pode ficar com seu mundinho

Eu não tô nem aí

Tô nem aí, tô nem aí

Não vem falar dos seus problemas

Que eu não vou ouvir

Boca fechada, sem embaraços

Eu te dei todas as chances de ser um bom rapaz

Mas fui vencida pelo cansaço

Nosso amor foi enterrado e descansa em paz

Já nem lembro seu nome

Seu telefone eu fiz questão de apagar

Aceitei os meus erros, me reinventei e virei a página

Agora eu tô em outra

Tô nem aí, tô nem aí

Pode ficar com seu mundinho

Eu não tô nem aí

Tô nem aí, tô nem aí

Não vem falar dos seus problemas

Que eu não vou ouvir

Tô nem aí, tô nem aí

Pode ficar com seu mundinho

Eu não to nem aí

Tô nem aí, tô nem aí

Não vem falar dos seus problemas

# Amanhã não se sabe  

Como as folhas com o vento

Até onde vai dar o firmamento

Toda hora enquanto é tempo

Vivo aqui este momento

Hoje aqui amanhã não se sabe

Vivo agora antes que o dia acabe

Este instante nunca é tarde

Mal começou eu já estou com saudade

Me abraça, me aceita

Me aceita assim meu amor

Me abraça, me beija

Me aceita assim como eu sou

E deixa ser o que for

Como as ondas com a maré

Até onde não vai dar mais pé

Este instante tal qual é

Vivo aqui e seja o que Deus quiser

Hoje aqui não importa pra onde vamos

Vivo agora não tenho outros planos

E é tão fácil viver sonhando

Enquanto isso a vida vai passando

Me abraça, me aceita

Me aceita assim meu amor

Me abraça, me beija

Me aceita assim como eu sou

E deixa ser o que for

# White Flag  

I know you think that I shouldn't still love you

I'll tell you that

But if I didn't say it, well, I'd still have felt it

Where's the sense in that?

I promise I'm not trying to make your life harder

Or return to where we were

But I will go down with this ship

And I won't put my hands up and surrender

There will be no white flag above my door

I'm in love and always will be

I know I left too much mess and destruction

To come back again

And I caused nothing but trouble

I understand if you can't talk to me again

And if you live by the rules of "it's over"

Then I'm sure that that makes sense

But I will go down with this ship

And I won't put my hands up and surrender

There will be no white flag above my door

I'm in love and always will be

And when we meet

Which I'm sure we will

All that was there

Will be there still

I'll let it pass

And hold my tongue

And you will think

That I've moved on

I will go down with this ship

And I won't put my hands up and surrender

There will be no white flag above my door

I'm in love and always will be

I will go down with this ship

And I won't put my hands up and surrender

There will be no white flag above my door

I'm in love and always will be

I will go down with this ship

And I won't put my hands up and surrender

There will be no white flag above my door

I'm in love and always will be

# Here With Me  

I didn't hear you leave

I wonder, "How am I still here?"

And I don't wanna move a thing

It might change my memory

Oh, I am what I am

I'll do what I want

But I can't hide

And I won't go

I won't sleep

I can't breathe

Until you're resting here with me

And I won't leave

And I can't hide

I cannot be

Until you're resting here with me

I don't wanna call my friends

For they might wake me from this dream

And I can't leave this bed

Risk forgetting all that's been

Oh, I am what I am

I'll do what I want

But I can't hide

And I won't go

I won't sleep

And I can't breathe

Until you're resting here with me

And I won't leave

And I can't hide

I cannot be

Until you're resting here

And I won't go

And I won't sleep

And I can't breathe

Until you're resting here with me

And I won't leave

And I can't hide

I cannot be

Until you're resting here with me

Oh, I am what I am

I'll do what I want

But I can't hide

And I won't go

I won't sleep

And I can't breathe

Until you're resting here with me

And I won't leave

And I can't hide

I cannot be

Until you're resting here

And I won't go

And I won't sleep

And I can't breathe

Until you're resting here with me

And I won't leave

And I can't hide

I cannot be

Until you're resting here with me

# My Lover's Gone  

My lover's gone

His boots no longer by my door

He left at dawn

And as I slept, I felt him go

Returns no more

I will not watch the ocean

My lover's gone

No earthly ships will ever bring him home again

Bring him home again

My lover's gone

I know that kiss will be my last

No more his song

The tune upon his lips has passed

I sing alone

While I watch the ocean

My lover's gone

No earthly ships will ever bring him home again

Bring him home again

My lover's gone

His boots no longer by my door

He left at dawn

And as I slept, I felt him go

Returns no more

I will not watch the ocean

My lover's gone

No earthly ships will ever bring him home again

Bring him home again

# I Don't Want to Miss a Thing  

I could stay awake just to hear you breathin'

Watch you smile while you are sleepin'

While you're far away and dreamin'

I could spend my life in this sweet surrender

I could stay lost in this moment forever

Well, every moment spent with you is a moment I treasure

Don't wanna close my eyes

I don't wanna fall asleep

'Cause I'd miss you, babe

And I don't wanna miss a thing

'Cause even when I dream of you (Even when I dream)

The sweetest dream would never do

I'd still miss you, babe

And I don't wanna miss a thing

Lyin' close to you, feelin' your heart beatin'

And I'm wonderin' what you're dreamin'

Wonderin' if it's me you're seein'

Then I kiss your eyes and thank God we're together

And I just wanna stay with you in this moment forever

Forever and ever

I don't wanna close my eyes

I don't wanna fall asleep

'Cause I'd miss you, babe

And I don't wanna miss a thing

'Cause even when I dream of you (Even when I dream)

The sweetest dream would never do

I'd still miss you, babe

And I don't wanna miss a thing

I don't wanna miss one smile

I don't wanna miss one kiss

Well, I just wanna be with you

Right here with you, just like this

I just wanna hold you close

I feel your heart so close to mine

And just stay here in this moment

For all the rest of time

Yeah, yeah, yeah

Don't wanna close my eyes

Don't wanna fall asleep

'Cause I'd miss you, babe

And I don't wanna miss a thing

'Cause even when I dream of you

The sweetest dream would never do

I'd still miss you, babe

And I don't wanna miss a thing

I don't wanna close my eyes

I don't wanna fall asleep

'Cause I'd miss you, babe

And I don't wanna miss a thing

'Cause even when I dream of you

The sweetest dream would never do

I'd still miss you, babe

And I don't wanna miss a thing

Don't wanna close my eyes

I don't wanna fall asleep, yeah

I don't wanna miss a thing

# Same Mistake  

Saw the world turning in my sheets

And once again, I cannot sleep

Walk out the door and up the street

Look at the stars beneath my feet

Remember rights that I did wrong

So here I go

Oh ooh-

Oh ooh-

Oh ooh-

Hello, hello. There is no place I cannot go

My mind is muddy but my heart is heavy. Does it show?

I lose the track that loses me, so here I go

Oh ooh-

Oh ooh-

Oh ooh-

And so I sent some men to fight, and one came back at dead of night

Said he'd seen my enemy. Said he looked just like me

So I set out to cut myself and here I go

Oh ooh-

Oh ooh-

Oh ooh-

I'm not calling for a second chance

I'm screaming at the top of my voice

Give me reason, but don't give me choice

Cause I'll just make the same mistake again

Oh ooh-

And maybe someday we will meet

And maybe talk, and not just speak

Don't buy the promises, cause

There are no promises I keep

And my reflection troubles me

So here I go

Ah ooh-

Ah ooh-

Ah ooh-

I'm not calling for a second chance

I'm screaming at the top of my voice

Give me reason, but don't give me choice

Cause I'll just make the same mistake

I'm not calling for a second chance

I'm screaming at the top of my voice

Give me reason, but don't give me choice

Cause I'll just make the same mistake again

Ah ooh-

Ah ooh-

Ah ooh-

Ah ooh-

Saw the world turning in my sheets (Ah ooh-)

And once again, I cannot sleep (Ah ooh-)

Walk out the door and up the street (Ah ooh-)

Look at the stars (Ah ooh-)

Look at the stars fall down (Ah ooh-)

And wonder where (Ah ooh-)

Did I go wrong?

# Take My Breath Away  

Watching every motion in my foolish lover's game

On this endless ocean, finally lovers know no shame

Turning and returning to some secret place inside

Watching in slow motion as you turn around and say

"Take my breath away"

"Take my breath away"

Watching, I keep waiting, still anticipating love

Never hesitating to become the fated ones

Turning and returning to some secret place to hide

Watching in slow motion as you turn to me and say

"My love, take my breath away"

Through the hourglass, I saw you

In time, you slipped away

When the mirror crashed I called you

And turned to hear you say

"If only for today, I am unafraid"

"Take my breath away"

"Take my breath away"

Watching every motion in this foolish lover's game

Haunted by the notion somewhere there's a love in flames

Turning and returning to some secret place inside

Watching in slow motion as you turn my way and say

"Take my breath away"

"My love, take my breath away"

"My love, take my breath away, my love"

"My love, take my breath away, my love"

"Take my breath away..."

# Right Here Waiting  

Oceans apart, day after day

And I slowly go insane

I hear your voice on the line

But it doesn't stop the pain

If I see you next to never

Then how can we say forever?

Wherever you go, whatever you do

I will be right here waiting for you

Whatever it takes or how my heart breaks

I will be right here waiting for you

I took for granted, all the times

That I thought would last somehow

I hear the laughter, I taste the tears

But I can't get near you now

Oh, can't you see it, baby

You've got me going crazy

Wherever you go, whatever you do

I will be right here waiting for you

Whatever it takes or how my heart breaks

I will be right here waiting for you

I wonder how we can survive

This romance

But in the end if I'm with you

I'll take the chance

Oh, can't you see it, baby

You've got me going crazy

Wherever you go, whatever you do

I will be right here waiting for you

Whatever it takes or how my heart breaks

I will be right here waiting for you

Waiting for you

# I Just Called To Say I Love You  

No New Year's Day to celebrate

No chocolate-covered candy hearts to give away

No first of spring, no song to sing

In fact, here's just another ordinary day

No April rain, no flowers bloom

No wedding Saturday within the month of June

But what it is, it's something true

Made up of these three words that I must say to you

I just called to say I love you

I just called to say how much I care

I just called to say I love you

And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

No summer's high, no warm July

No harvest moon to light one tender August night

No autumn breeze, no falling leaves

Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies

No Libra sun, no Halloween

No giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring

But what it is, though old, so new

To fill your heart like no three words could ever do

I just called to say I love you

I just called to say how much I care, I do

I just called to say I love you

And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

I just called to say I love you, yeah

I just called to say how much I care, I do

I just called to say I love you

And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

Of my heart, of my heart

Baby, of my heart
