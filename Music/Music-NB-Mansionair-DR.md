# A Little Death

[Verse 1]

Vacancy was lit

The guests were checking in

The concierge was cold

The water pipes had mold all over them

The room was fit for two

The bed was left in ruins

The neighbor was knocking, yeah

But no one would let him in

[Chorus]

Touch me, yeah

I want you to touch me there

Make me feel like I am breathing

Feel like I am human

[Verse 2]

Dancing through the night

A vodka and a Sprite

A glimpse of her silhouettes

A night that they never forget

[Chorus]

Touch me, yeah

I want you to touch me there

Make me feel like I am breathing

Feel like I am human

Touch me, yeah

I want you to touch me there

Make me feel like I am breathing

Feel like I am human

[Bridge]

She sought death on a queen-sized bed

And he had said, "Darlin', your looks can kill"

So now you're dead

[Chorus]

Touch me, yeah

I want you to touch me there

Make me feel like I am breathing

Feel like I am human

Touch me, yeah

I want you to touch me there

Make me feel like I am breathing

Feel like I am human again

## honest the neighbourhood



[Verse 1]

Patience, test my patience

If I made it too hard for you maybe you should’ve changed it

Say it, you should say it

Cause I'd say I was wrong just to make it fill all the spaces

Waiting, always waiting

If I gave you control would you say that we could've saved it?



[Pre-Chorus]

I hope you find a way to be yourself someday

In weakness or in strength

Change can be amazing

So I pray for the best, I pray for the best for you



[Chorus]

I wish you could be honest

I wish you could be honest with me, with me

I wish you could be honest

I wish you could be honest with me, with me



[Verse 2]

Chasing, always chasing dreams

Why’d you stick around, why’d you stay with me?

Why’d you fake it?

Hesitation is killing me too

But I couldn’t save it, I couldn’t save it

[Pre-Chorus]

I hope you find a way to be yourself someday

In weakness or in strength

Change can be amazing

So I pray for the best, I pray for the best for you

I hope you find a way to be yourself someday

In weakness or in strength

Change can be amazing

So I pray for the best, I pray for the best for you



[Chorus]

I wish you could be honest

I wish you could be honest with me, with me

I wish you could be honest

I wish you could be honest with me, with me

I wish you could be honest

I wish you could be honest with me, with me

I wish you could be honest

I wish you could be honest with me, with me

## Dangerous (feat. YG)

[Verse 1: Jesse Rutherford]

Ridin' round in my city, same thing I used to do

Got a new girl with me

I could have another one if I wanted to but no

Might call another one this afternoon, I won't

I did it, look who I brought with me

Ridin' round your city, vibin' out in your city

Sold out in your city, but I think you earned this

I feel like you're worth it

Your blue eyes and those red lips

That got you on my guest list

Don't talk much, I don't say shit

And you lay down and we make it up (Make it up, make it up, make it up, make)

Fuck what your mother say, let's run away

Replay on that Goldchain

Drivin' round in my Escalade

Doin' 88 on PCH, let's go (Go, go)

[Chorus: Jesse Rutherford]

We're made to love, we're made to love

We're made to love, we're made to love

But you're dangerous, you're dangerous, you're dangerous

For both of us, you're dangerous

[Interlude: Jesse Rutherford & YG's Girlfriend]

Hmm, hmm

Answer the phone nigga

Nigga, answer the phone

[Verse 2: YG]

Texting and calling while I'm with my bitch

You be puttin' me thru some shit

But that pussy good as shit

Now she goin' thru my shit

Ask me "Who is this? Who's that?"

Smell my dick and asked last night where you was at

So if I lie now she'll probably find the truth later

But if I tell the truth she'll probably wanna leave the player

And if she leave the player, who I'm gon' fuck with?

Can't fuck with you cause you too comfortable being my side bitch

But fuck that, I told her

Damn, that wasn't smart, damn, I fucked up

Now that arguing 'bout to start

She like "Who is this, did she suck yo dick?

Always that same way, YG, do you love this bitch?

This the same chick from last time, I saw you creepin' with

You took her out to eat and shit, ooh, I hate this bitch"

Goddamn, I gotta put an end to this triangle relationship

I gotta stay away from you 'cause your pussy too dangerous

[Chorus: Jesse Rutherford]

We're made to love, we're made to love

We're made to love, we're made to love

(Hey, but you, babe, you're dangerous!)

But you're dangerous, you're dangerous, (You're danger) you're dangerous

For both of us, you're dangerous

Honto wa watashi kizuitetan desu

Anata ga watashi o mite ite kureta koto

Jaa... Rize san mo

[Verse 1: Mitchel Cave]

Alright, alright, woah

Why you pointing at me with that knife?

I've been cutting corners all my life, girl

The terror doesn't blossom overnight, no

She's running through the city in a rampage

Pressing on her fingers 'til the bones break

There's blood all in her nose from the propane

But a needle to the skin will make the pain fade (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: Mitchel Cave]

Yeah, ah-ah

This is what I do, ah-ah

Take another bite, ah-ah

Big enough to chew

[Chorus: Mitchel Cave]

She said, "Careful, or you'll lose it"

But, girl, I'm only human

And I know there's a blade where your heart is

And you know how to use it

And you can take my flesh if you want, girl

But, baby, don't abuse it

These voices in my head screaming, "Run now"

I'm praying that they're human

[Verse 2: Mitchel Cave]

Rollin', rollin', rolling back your eyes to your mind like

Oh, woah, the pressure in the gland's tight

Yeah, woah, yeah, it's either kill or be killed like

Oh, woah, the blood is either poured or it’s spilt like

Yeah, ah-ah (Ooh-ah)

This is what I do, ah-ah

Take another bite, ah-ah

Big enough to chew

She said, "Careful, or you'll lose it"

But, girl, I'm only human

And I know there's a blade where your heart is

And you know how to use it

And you can take my flesh if you want, girl

But, baby, don't abuse it

These voices in my head screaming, "Run now"

I'm praying that they're human

Alright, alright, woah

Love you, but you cannot spend the night, nah

Tell me the things that you don’t normally tweet

Acid and LSD and smokin' blunts on the beach

69 down 69, so we can both get a piece, yeah

I’ve been cutting corners like my whole life

Backstabbing bitches tryna' kill me with the whole knife

Day I die'll be the only day a nigga ghostwrite

When I go, they'll treat me like a god if this shit goes right

[Chorus: Mitchel Cave]

She said, "Careful, or you'll lose it"

But, girl, I'm only human

And I know there's a blade where your heart is

And you know how to use it

And you can take my flesh if you want, girl

But, baby, don't abuse it (Calm down)

These voices in my head screaming, "Run now" (Don't run)

I'm praying that they're human

[Outro: Mitchel Cave]

Please understand that I'm trying my hardest

My head's a mess, but I'm trying regardless

Anxiety is one hell of a problem

She's latching onto me, I can't resolve it

It's not right, it's not fair, it's not fair

It's not fair, it's not fair, it's not fair

Oh, no, no, no, ooh-ooh

Don't run, don't run

Okay, okay, dirty habits, well you

# Dark Rooms

## Olga Kurylenko Dark Rooms

Marion, mascara on

As-tu inventé cette chanson?

Sleepless nights, constellations

En orbite, dans ma tête

Around a dying sun...

Tes yeux dans ma chambre

Ton corps dans l'écran

Ta voix dans mon cœur

It's my stars I cannot stand

I can feel my heart breaking in two pieces

One for you, one for them

Wasted, 4AM

Like a shooting stars burns to explode

The black hole that used to be my soul

Waiting, taking in nothing

Waiting, taking in nothing

Olga Kurylenko

Naked, in a row

Show me your lullaby

Before I burn and die

Like a shooting stars burns to explode

The black hole that used to be my soul

Waiting, taking in nothing

Waiting, taking in nothing

Waiting, taking in nothing

Waiting, taking in nothing

## Beyond the Lens Dark Rooms

I never quite fit in

Always wore the wrong grin

The wrong words, the wrong clothes

The wrong hair, the wrong nose

Terrified of what you might do

If i ever got up the courage to…

Baby, look

Deep into my eyes

Maybe you should lie down

Maybe you are getting tired

I could be your friend

I could be your savior

But beyond the lens

I am something more sinister

I've spent some time looking at your page

The photos, the comments, the updates

I know your birthday, counted your friends

Now all i need is a sign from you and some confidence

Why won't you love me?

Everybody love me all right?

I need somebody to love me, love me tonight

Baby, look

Deep into my eyes

Maybe you should lie down

Maybe you are getting tired

I could be your friend

I could be your savior

But beyond the lens

I am something more sinister

## Keep It Inside Dark Rooms

Thought i'd be going on by now

With a love for you that's true somehow

And you'd be screaming at me, screaming at me

Don't stop

Don't stop

Don't stop

Don't stop

Now where did all those good looks go?

My effervescent charm and glow?

The poetry escapes me

And i can see you turning

I can see you turning

All those feelings that you hide, that burn you alive

Ever since you were a child, gotta keep it inside

Your throat goes dry and you're buried alive

In your dreams when you die, gotta keep it inside

Cry, cry, no reason why

Ever since you were a child, gotta keep it insidе

Every lie, evеry last sigh

Everything that's denied, gotta keep it inside…

Thought i'd be further along

Doing something that i knew was wrong

And you'd be blowing on my neck

And i'd be running out of breath

Don't stop

Don't stop

Don't stop

Don't stop

And where did all those good times go?

The valley of tomorrow

I'll keep waiting for you

I'll keep waiting for you

In every little heaven

Every last woman

Every depression

Every last rejection

The good luck i'm missing

Everything that i'm missing

(Such a beautiful woman)

Afraid of what i'm thinking

Everything i'm dreaming

All of our children

All of our chil-

All those feelings that you hide, that burn you alive

Ever since you were a child, gotta keep it inside

Your throat goes dry and you're buried alive

In your dreams when you die, gotta keep it inside

All those feelings that you hide, that burn you alive

Ever since you were a child, gotta keep it inside

Your throat goes dry and you're buried alive

In your dreams when you die, gotta keep it inside

Cry, cry, no reason why

Ever since you were a child, gotta keep it inside

Every lie, every last sigh

Everything that's denied, gotta keep it inside

## I Get Overwhelmed

[Verse 1]

Are you runnin late?

Did you sleep too much?

All the awful dreams

Felt real enough

Is your lover there?

Is she wakin up?

Did she die in the night?

And leave you alone?

Alone

[Verse 2]

Mirror, mirror

There's your crooked nose

Boring hair

A thousand wrinkles

No children

Just emptiness

No place like home

Just a fucking mess

Mess

[Verse 3]

20 messages

Did you hurt your thumbs?

On a stupid game

Getting nothing done

With your longest track

Your highest score

While you crush your back

And lament the war

War

[Verse 4]

All the women

That you wanna fuck

On the internet

Wouldn't give you a second look

Did you fool yourself?

That's privilege

That's power without power

That's a business

Business

[Verse 5]

But we know "you" is "I"

And I get overwhelmed

Can't sleep at night

Can't convince myself

To turn it off

To let go

Gotta make sense

Of the fucking war

War

[Verse 6]

Am I runnin late?

I get overwhelmed

All the awful dreams

All the bright screens

Is my lover there?

Are we breakin up?

Did she find someone else?

And leave me alone?

Alone...

# Mansionair

## Alibi

[Verse 1]

Haven't seen you 'round

Got me in a craze

Been going through an awkward phase

I hate the taste it leaves us

I know your light's gone out

But are you still awake?

Stuck inside a dull malaise

You seem so out of reach now

[Chorus]

You're one step in and out again

It's useless

It was everything and the colours spin

We lose it

Thought you'd be my alibi

[Post-Chorus]

Alibi

Alibi

Alibi

[Verse 2]

So you're lying on my couch

But you want to give it space

I'm slipping into your disdain

Don't be so cold and reckless

Well, maybe you're too proud

I can see it in your face

Oh, the silence could have cut the air

[Chorus]

You're one step in and out again

It's useless

It was everything and the colours spin

We lose it

Thought you'd be my alibi

[Post-Chorus]

Alibi

Alibi

Alibi

[Outro]

You're one step in and out again

Alibi

You're one step in and out again

Alibi

It's useless

It's useless

## Easier

[Verse 1]

Face up, untouched, gazing at the ceiling

Game's up, never bring you down

Face up, our love's, craving for some feeling

Game's up, we're nowhere to be found

I'm stuck, I'm stuck, I'm stuck here in my skin

I'm stuck, I'm stuck, I'm stuck with you

[Chorus]

Tell me it gets easier, tell me it gets easier

Tell me it gets easier, that I'll figure it out

Tell me it gets easier, tell me it gets easier

Oh, tell me it gets easier, that I'll figure it out

[Post-Chorus]

Easier, easier, easier, easier

Easier, easier, easier, easier

Easier, easier, easier, easier

Easier, easier, easier, easier

[Verse 2]

Face up, untouched, craving for some healing

Take off, you're never around

Game's up, it’s too much, oh you're the king of cheating

Take off, I'm staring at the ground

[Chorus]

Tell me it gets easier, tell me it gets easier

Oh, tell me it gets easier, that I'll figure it out

Tell me it gets easier, tell me it gets easier

Tell me it gets easier, that I'll figure it out

[Bridge]

(Easier, easier, easier, easier

Easier, easier, easier, easier)

I'm stuck, I'm stuck, I'm stuck with you

[Outro]

Easier, easier, easier, easier

Easier, easier, easier, easier (Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)

Easier, easier, easier, easier

Easier, easier, easier, easier

Easier, easier, easier, easier

Easier, easier, easier, easier

## Technicolour

[Verse 1]

We dive into the blue

I can't hold onto you

I'm staring the illusion in the eye

And when the colors blur

We forget who we were

When all we need is technicolour

[Pre-Chorus]

And I lost my grip

When all we need is technicolour

I give into it

[Chorus]

We were in love

We were in love

Oh, we were in love (Oh, oh)

We were in love (Oh, oh)

And all we need is technicolour

[Verse 2]

We dip into the pool

Cold water covers you

It's draining all the colour from your eyes

And as we start to fade

Your lips, they turn to grey

When all we need is technicolour

[Bridge]

And I know my lack of love will drown us out

And I know I cannot keep what wasn't found

'Cause the fire's out that used to burn in me

Close your eyes to see what's really happening

[Chorus]

We were in love

We were in love

Oh, we were in love (Oh, oh)

We were in love (Oh, oh)

And all we need is technicolour (Oh, oh)

And all we need is technicolour (Oh, oh)

And all we need is technicolour (Oh, oh)

## Heartbeat

[Verse 1]

I can feel your heartbeat, baby

It's something I cannot see, it's crazy

I can feel like I know

How you feel all alone

[Verse 2]

We dance beneath the sycamore

I'm calling out your love to fall

You know it's hard to find

Golden windows in the sun

[Chorus]

I can feel your heartbeat

I can feel your heartbeat

I can feel your heartbeat

## Astronaut (Something About Your Love)

[Verse 1]

Slow down, stepping up my game

Tied to you, try not sink on through the cracks

And maybe I could forget this town

Maybe I should get out

[Chorus]

Oh, there's something about your love, can you feel it?

Oh, there's something about your love, can you feel it?

[Post-Chorus]

Can you feel it?

Can you feel it?

Can you feel it?

Can you feel it?

Can you feel it?

[Verse 2]

Right now, I'm feeling like an astronaut

I fade into the thought of coming back to you

And maybe I should forget this town

And maybe I could get out

[Chorus]

Oh, there's something about your love, can you feel it?

Oh, there's something about your love, can you feel it?

Oh, there's something about your love, can you feel it?

Oh, there's something about your love, can you feel it?

Can you feel it?

[Post-Chorus]

Can you feel it?

Oh, there's something about your love, can you feel it?

Oh, there's something about your love, can you feel it?

Can you feel it?

## Violet City

[Verse 1]

Wide awake in this violet city

Where it washes over me

It hurts to say that I want you with me

Just draped across my frame

[Chorus]

Ooh, I can't help myself, the moment that I let it go

Is when I find I'm in control, in control

Ooh, I need something else, the moment that I let it go

Is when I find I'm in control, I'm in control

[Post-Chorus]

Ooh

In control, in control

Ooh, I can't help myself, the moment that I let it go

Is when I find I'm in control, I'm in control

[Verse 2]

In a maze of my expectation

I just feel so far away

Holding onto these empty spaces

As I try to find my way

'Cause I'm somewhere else

Surrounded by the city shelf

Trying to appease all my desires

'Cause I'm somewhere else

Believe me, I'm beside myself

I've been tryna to change

[Chorus]

Ooh, I can't help myself, the moment that I let it go

Is when I find I'm in control, in control

Ooh, I need something else, the moment that I let it go

Is when I find I'm in control, I'm in control

[Post-Chorus]

Ooh, I can't help myself, the moment that I let it go

Is when I find I'm in control, I'm in control

[Outro]

Is when I find I'm in control, I'm in control

## We Could Leave

[Verse 1]

I'm only flickering, it’s just a phase I'm in

Not the shape I fit

How'd I get so tongue tied?

So sorry I’m vacant

I'm watching from the sidelines

While all the noise, it holds me still

And I wanna be by your side

But I ain't got the patience

Been waiting for you all night

Come and fill the space I fill

We could leave and grace the night lights

'Fore everybody vacates

But I'm caught up in your guidelines

With all this time left to kill

[Chorus]

We don't have to have everything at once

The light upon your figure is pulling on the trigger

We don't have to have everything at once

The light upon your figure

Got me wrapped around your finger

[Verse 2]

I heard her whispering as I was walking in

It's something I can’t fix

Oh, how I’d get so tongue tied?

So sorry I am vacant

Been watching from the sidelines

While all the noise, it holds me still

[Chorus]

We don't have to have everything at once

The light upon your figure is pulling on the trigger

We don’t have to have everything at once

The light upon your figure

Has got me wrapped around your finger

[Bridge]

It's pulling on the trigger

It's pulling on the trigger

I'm wrapped around your finger

Wrapped around your finger

Pulling on the trigger

[Outro]

It’s pulling on the trigger

(We don't have to have everything at once)

It's pulling on the trigger

(We don't have to have everything at once)

It's pulling on the trigger

It's pulling on the trigger

## Shadows

[Verse 1]

The streets are quiet and my heart feels like fire

So I guess and play the waiting game

Make no mistake, my heart lies awake

Down the tunnel I made, I can feel this way

For you, for you

[Chorus]

I keep running from my shadow

Hide from the sun; I won't be found

Everywhere I go, it follows

I find my feet when I'm off the ground

And I keep running from my shadow

Hide from the sun; I won't be found

And everywhere I go, it follows

I find my feet when I'm off the ground

And oh, we're running from my shadows

Oh, we're running from my shadows

[Verse 2]

The streets are quiet and it feels so right

To be out of line like the shape of my veins

For you, for you, for you

[Chorus]

And I keep running from my shadow

Hide from the sun; I won't be found

And everywhere I go, it follows

I find my feet when I'm off the ground

And I keep running from my shadow

Hide from the sun; I won't be found

And everywhere I go, it follows

I find my feet when I'm off the ground

And oh, we're running from my shadow

Oh, we're running from my shadows

Woah, and oh, we're running from my shadows

Oh, we're running from my shadows

[Outro]

We're so out of line

We're so out of line

We're so out of line

We're so out of line

## Waiting Room

[Verse 1]

You were waiting for a girl to take you by the hand

Play it over in your mind, tell me everything again

I am in the backseat trying to find out what it means

And in the moment

It's the only thing that matters

It's the only thing that matters

Watching from the other side, it is nothing like I planned

I was waiting for my time to tell you everything I'm in

And it's so clear, it's see-through

And right now, it's the only thing that matters to me

[Chorus]

For you, I am in the waiting room

For you, I am in the waiting room

[Post-Chorus]

It's the only thing that matters

[Verse 2]

Now I watch the passers-by way above from this height

Sea of taxis down below being pulled like the tide

I just really need a voice, someone here to change my mind

'Cause it's all so out of sight

And this really fucking matters to me

[Chorus]

For you, I am in the waiting room

For you, I am in the waiting room

[Post-Chorus]

It's the only thing that matters

It's the only thing that matters

It's the only thing

[Outro]

For you (It's the only thing that matters)

I am in the waiting room (It's the only thing that matters)

For you (It's the only thing that matters)

I am in the waiting room (It's the only thing that matters)

## Falling

[Verse 1]

I think I'll borrow tomorrow's happiness for today

Leant on the crux of all this love and it leant away

Falling, I'm falling, I'm falling, I'm falling down

Falling, I'm falling, I'm falling, I'm falling down

Next to you

Pin a string in the middle and tie it to my chest

I'm spinning around your five mile radius, don't look away

Falling, I'm falling, I'm falling, I'm falling down

Falling, I'm falling, I'm falling, I'm falling down

Next to you

[Chorus]

I try to reach for the ceiling

Scared that I'm letting you down

'Cause I'm so caught up on this feeling, this feeling

I keep falling, I'm falling, I'm falling, I'm falling down

Falling, I'm falling, I'm falling, I'm falling down

[Verse 2]

Today now swallowed by all my sorrow, in a way

I'm losing myself, I'm nowhere now, can I stay?

'Cause I believe that I have seen enough

There's something that I've been dreaming of

Next to you

[Chorus]

I try to reach for the ceiling

Scared that I'm letting you down

'Cause I'm so caught up on this feeling

That heaven may never be found

And I try to reach for the ceiling

I know that I'm letting you down

'Cause I'm so caught up on this feeling, this feeling

[Post Chorus]

I keep falling, I'm falling, I'm falling, I'm falling down

Falling, I'm falling, I'm falling, I'm falling down

Falling, I'm falling, I'm falling, I'm falling down

Falling, I'm falling, I'm falling, I'm falling down

Next to you

## Harlem

[Verse 1]

Run our truth

Like ourself in the backseat

Time, time means nothing

Don't close your eyes

[Chorus]

Maybe, maybe you're all I need

All that I need

Don't sleep, don't sleep

Just watch the road slip beneath your feet

[Verse 2]

Sink into the seams

Sink into me

[Chorus]

Maybe, maybe you're all I need

All that I need

Don't sleep, don't sleep

I'll watch the road

[Chorus]

Maybe, maybe you're all I need

All that I need

Maybe, maybe you're all I need

Maybe

Maybe

## Best Behaviour

[Verse 1]

Lights are out and I am not around

The tide will push and pull me in, but I won't make a sound

Thought I knew the way to get it out

The best map is useless if you can't find yourself

[Chorus]

I am on my best behaviour

I am like everybody else

I am on my best behaviour

Must admit I'm not myself

I am on my best behaviour

I don't like everybody else

I am on my best behaviour

Must admit I'm not myself

I watch it all go slowly

[Verse 2]

I play the game, floating with the crowd

My nails cut beneath the bones, oh, I am not so proud

These walls are foul, they're closing now

I'm crawling out of my mind, that no one needs me so

[Chorus]

'Cause I am on my best behaviour

I am like everybody else

I am on my best behaviour

Must admit I'm not myself

I am on my best behaviour

I am like everybody else

I am on my best behaviour

Must admit I'm not myself

I watch it all go slowly

[Outro]

Fake, I'm not

Fake, I'm not

Fake, I'm not

Fake, I'm not

Fake, I'm not

Fake, I'm not

Fake, I'm not

Fake, I'm not

## I Won't Take No for an Answer

Hey, you run like a ribbon

Fall unforgiven over me

I always wanna be so far in some place else

Now, I take all of my chances

And I won't take no for an answer

Oh, oh

Hey, you run like the ribbon

And fall unforgiven over me

I always wanna be so far in some place else

Now, I take all of my chances

And I won't take no for an answer

Oh, ooh, yeah

Oh whoa, ooh

I won't take no for an answer

And I won't take no for an answer

And I won't take no for an answer

## Heirloom

My heirloom, dreaming to hold you

High underwater

My heirloom, where have you gone to?

My knees on the altar with nothing left

My heirloom, why can't I stay here

And breathe underwater? I resist

[Refrain]

I'm swallowing air, I'm barely breathing

I'm dying to have you here

[Chorus]

Under the water as the light refracts

Trying to hold you, my heirloom breath

[Verse 2]

My heirloom, my lips have turned blue

Searching for treasures that don't exist

[Refrain]

I'm swallowing air, I'm barely breathing

I'm dying to have you here

[Bridge]

And if I could, I would stay

If I could, I would stay

If I could, I would stay, ooh

[Chorus]

Under the water as the light refracts

Trying to hold you, but nothing is left

And I am now closer to you than death

[Outro]

Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh

Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh

Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh

Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh

Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
