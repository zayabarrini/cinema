# Dreamin 

[Intro]

One, two, three, go

[Verse 1]

Let me mean it, what I say

I've been feelin’

Yeah, I'm dreamin' my life away

Just need to level with sky

It seems to live on my mind

[Chorus]

I’ve been dreamin', feelin' this way

I've been needin' something else

I'll know what it is when I see it

Can't hold on anymore to this feelin'

[Verse 2]

With no senses, ain’t no sentence

Makin’ sense of us

Did I mention life's intention

Never steered me the right way?

Oh, I’ve been fallin'

[Chorus]

I've been dreamin', feelin’ this way

I've been needin' something else

I'll know what it is when I see it

Can't hold on anymorе to this feelin'

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]

Say I've been fallin' in love and in the mornin'

Thеn I feel nothing again

Please don't let me forget fallin' in love, it's all good

And in the mornin' then you call me again

Don't call me again, don't call me again

When you faded, no need to call me again

I've been feelin'

[Chorus]

I've been dreamin', feelin' this way

I've been needin' something else

I'll know what it is when I see it

Can't hold on anymore to this feelin'

I've been dreamin', feelin' this way

I've been needin' something else

I'll know what it is when I see it

Can't hold on anymore to this feelin'

[Outro]

Yeah, I'm dreamin' my life away

# What I Am 

[Verse 1]

I've been drinking absinthe

I just did the math, it ain't adding up

I've had enough of running 'round this board game

You can know your own name, I won't give it up

[Pre-Chorus]

Am I crazy? Am I foolish?

Am I stupid for playin' these games with you?

[Chorus]

If I told you I loved you

Would you say that it's fucked up?

If I told you they're flyin'

Would you say that you looked up?

Don't take me for what I'm sayin'

Just take me for what I am

'Cause this is where I'm stayin'

My two feet are in the sand

[Verse 2]

I've been readin' old shit and I can't make sense of it

Ain't no conspiracy that can save me

Livin' in the moment feels good to me till it hurts

And I need somebody

See upcoming R&B shows

Get tickets for your favorite artists

[Pre-Chorus]

Am I crazy? Am I foolish?

Am I stupid for playin' these games with you?

[Chorus]

If I told you I loved you

Would you say that it's fucked up?

If I told you they'rе flyin'

Would you say that you looked up?

Don't take me for what I'm sayin'

Just takе me for what I am

'Cause this is where I'm stayin'

My two feet are in the sand

[Bridge]

Take me as I am

I'm tired of dancin' around the point

Sharp and it is jagged

Like the shape of glass and it steals my voice

[Chorus]

If I told you I loved you (Oh)

Would you say that it's fucked up?

If I told you they're flyin'

Would you say that you looked up? (Looked up)

Don't take me for what I'm sayin' (Don't)

Just take me for what I am

'Cause this is where I'm stayin'

My two feet are in the sand

[Outro]

If I told you I loved you

Would you say that it's fucked up?

If I told you they're flyin'

Would you say that you looked up?

Don't take me for what I'm sayin' (Ooh)

Just take me for what I am

'Cause this is where I'm stayin'

My two feet are in the sand

# Grateful 

[Verse 1]

I see your mother’s shine in your eye

I know that you’re mine and I'm cryin'

Tellin' you the things that are on my mind

When I think of you

[Pre-Chorus]

Yeah, I'm grateful for you

Love it when the rain comes down

Love it when the waves calm down

Yeah, I'm grateful for you

[Chorus]

These days I live to my depiction

Nowadays I'm findin' no affliction

These days I'm needin' no restriction

Feel like I'm finding new addiction

[Verse 2]

And it feels good

And I knew it would

When I'm tellin' this story it's complicated

Some mishaps I've been mournin' but I'm grateful for it

[Pre-Chorus]

Yeah, I'm grateful for you

Love it when the rain comes down (Yeah, I love it)

Love it when the waves calm down (When you can come down)

Yeah, I'm grateful for you

[Chorus]

These days I live to my depiction

Nowadays I'm findin' no affliction

These days I'm needin' no restriction

Feel like I'm finding new addiction

[Bridge]

Things change and I'm okay with what I'm not

It feels wasteful to be hateful

I'll be grateful for what I got

Things change and I'm okay with what I'm not

Feels wasteful to be hateful

I'll be grateful with what I got

[Chorus]

These days I live to my depiction (Yeah, I'm grateful)

Nowadays I'm findin' no affliction (Yeah, I'm grateful)

These days I'm needin' no restriction (For you)

Feel like I'm finding new addiction (Yeah, I'm grateful)

These days I live to my depiction (Yeah, I'm grateful)

Nowadays I'm foundin' no affliction (Yeah, I'm grateful)

These days I'm needin' no restriction (For you)

Feel like I'm finding new addiction (Yeah, I'm grateful)

[Outro]

Yeah, I'm grateful for you

# Alienated 

[Verse 1]

No two people are the same

Stand beside you, but just far enough away

Last night we were drinking

Tried to think away the pain

Made that age-old mistake

Tried to disconnect my body

From my soul, from my soul

See, I feel alright already on my own

[Pre-Chorus]

Can you let me be

Intoxicated on my own?

Do I need to answer

Or right my wrongs?

Am I home if I don't know this place?

[Chorus]

And I've been feeling alienated

On my spaceship alone

Say goodbye to the past

Leave it all with a laugh

'Cause you always was right all along

[Verse 2]

Know my reasons for the pain

But if you brought it in front of me

I know I'd do it all again

Call them beer can gains

I know from all the years

That my feelings nеver change

[Pre-Chorus]

Can you let mе be

Intoxicated on my own?

Do I need to answer

Or right my wrongs?

Am I home if I don't know this place?

[Chorus]

And I've been feeling alienated

On my spaceship alone

Say goodbye to the past

Leave it all with a laugh

'Cause you always was right all along

[Verse 3]

Did the winds make the noise of change?

Can the wings on your skin help you fly away?

'Cause it's always raining

And the clouds are always grey when you're away

[Chorus]

Yeah, I've been feeling alienated

On my spaceship alone

Say goodbye to the past (Ayy, ayy)

Leave it all with a laugh

'Cause you always was right all along

[Outro]

All along

Say goodbye to the past

Say goodbye

Ooh, ooh, ooh

Ah, ah-ah

# My Woman 

[Chorus]

Love me partly, leave me tonight

Say, "Don't fall in pieces," I might

Just for the fun of it

Let my mind just roll with it tonight

[Verse 1]

Since the stone age

I’ve been stoned in

Livin' lonely, on my own

Then she came along

Made me believe

Made me believe, I wouldn't leave her

I’m finished wastin' my time

I'm livin' blurred like those lines

[Pre-Chorus]

I fill my cup to forget her

Known it from the get up

This is my dеmise

My demise is what's holdin' mе

Grabbed a hold then took control of me

In my mind

[Chorus]

Love me partly, leave me tonight

Say, "Don't fall in pieces," I might

Just for the fun of it

Let my mind just roll with it tonight

[Verse 2]

Where did you wanna go?

Where did you stay last night?

Save my mind, save my time

Yeah, I know

I've been holdin’ on to somethin’

For so long, mm, with no eyes

Yeah, I've been blind

I’ve been blind

[Pre-Chorus]

I fill my cup to forget her

I've known it from the get up

This is my demise

[Chorus]

Love me partly, leave me tonight

Say, "Don't fall in pieces," I might

Just for the fun of it

Let my mind just roll with it tonight

Love me partly, leave me tonight

Say, "Don't fall in pieces," I might

Just for the fun of it

Let my mind just roll with it tonight

[Outro]

Just for the fun of it tonight

# How It Feels 

[Verse 1]

I've been getting old standin' by the river

Watch the water move but I don't move with her

[Pre-Chorus]

Shivers down my spine

Never forget to remind me I'm alive

[Chorus]

Till I let go of this moment

Something holdin' me to this place

I've been breakin', always fakin'

I'm just lyin' to your face

And I can't tell you how it feels

[Verse 2]

Can you tell me just one thing?

Can you give me a reason to stay?

'Cause the feelings I'm harborin' don't seem to

See the light of day

[Pre-Chorus]

Shivers down my spine

Never forget to remind me I'm alive

[Chorus]

Till I let go of this moment

Something holdin' me to this place

I've been breakin', always fakin'

I'm just lyin' to your face

And I can't tell you how it feels

[Bridge]

Bring me to my knees

I begged and pleaded

I asked to leave

But you insisted on stayin' and breakin' my heart

Breakin' my heart

Breakin' my heart

Breakin' my heart, yeah

[Chorus]

Till I let go of this moment

Something holdin' me to this place

I've been breakin', always fakin'

I'm just lyin' to your face

And I can't tell you how it feels

[Outro]

Till I let go of this moment

Something holdin' me to this place

# Stardust 

[Verse 1]

Pretty Christmas on a cardboard cup

I wait outside for you to pick me up

There's somethin' different in the way you touch

Different in the way you love

Different in the way you love

[Chorus]

Feels like stardust

Floatin' all around us

Shootin' right across a

Big black sky

Feels like stardust

Fallin' all around us

Funny how it found us

Maybe I, maybe I

(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]

I found perfume in a magazine

Oh-oh, oh-oh

Far off places in the moonlit scene

Hey-hey-hey (Hey-hey-hey)

And I love to be there with you

And I love to be there, baby too

'Cause you make anywhere at all

[Chorus]

Feel like stardust

Floatin' all around us

Shootin' right across a

Big black sky

Feels like stardust

Fallin' all around us

Funny how it found us

Maybe I, maybe I

(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]

Feels like stardust

Floatin' all around us

Shootin' right across a

Big black sky

Feels like stardust

Fallin' all around us

Funny how it found us

Maybe I, maybe I

Maybe I

# Gates of Hell 

[Verse 1]

So fucked, I can't feel my face

Know a couple people might call me a disgrace

But fuck them, I ain't looking up

Ain't never been one to give a second look

[Chorus]

I, I don't like you very much

But I keep putting up with your shit

I don't like you very much

But I keep putting up with your shit

[Verse 2]

Yeah, we drift away like islands

And I wanna float on this wave

A different day, time and meaning

And I know I'd do it all the same

[Chorus]

I, I don't like you very much

But I keep putting up with your shit

I don't like you very much

But I keep putting up with your shit

[Bridge]

You always come to mind

When I think to myself

What could have been

If we were living in Utopia

You always come to mind

[Chorus]

I, I don't like you very much

But I keep putting up with your shit

I don't like you very much

But I keep putting up with your shit

# Birds On A Cloud 

[Verse 1]

So when I wake up today

Hopin' I don't feel the same as I did last night

Shit-faced, not knowin' which way is up

Or down, or sideways, I'm frownin' anyway

[Chorus]

Please give me one more day of happiness

I need it, I need it

Please give me one more day of happiness

I need it, I need it

Please give me one more day

I need it, I need it

[Verse 2]

Wake up and bake up again

Fight and hope we make up again

Know when something's wrong, but somethin' inside tells me it's all okay

Even if it's strange, it's our love

[Chorus]

Please give me one more day of happiness

I need it, I need it

Please give me one more day of happiness

I need it, I need it

[Bridge]

When I think of things lost, think I fell off

Took my foot off the pedal

Think it's all suss and once I make a fuss

I don't need any medals

[Chorus]

Please give me one more day of happiness

I need it, I need it

Please give me one more day of happiness

I need it, I need it

Please give me one more day

[Outro]

From this place I'm runnin' from

I hope I kept my grace

From this place I'm runnin' from

I hope I kept my grace

From this place I'm runnin' from

I know I can't escape

I can't escape

# Concrete Kisses 

[Verse 1]

All I wanted was a cup of coffee

I got somethin' else or so it seems

Concrete kisses on my face and forehead

From where I fell last night on the street

[Pre-Chorus]

When I fell hard

All these scars on my skin where you left marks

When I fell hard

All these scars on my skin where you left marks

[Chorus]

This might not sound right, but it's alright, it's real

I'm finding my way on the highway this year

[Verse 2]

Got a big ol' cup of shit, told me to drink it

Middle finger to what you believe

Beginnings have a habit of endin'

Purgatory, I'm stuck here in between

[Chorus]

This might not sound right, but it's alright, it's real

I'm finding my way on the highway this year

[Bridge]

Why does this pain feel so good?

Pumpin' my brain like drunk blood

Feeling this way, there's no such thing as happy endings

See on my face, my heart changed

Lovin' this place I've created

Realize that I'm too good for games we've been playin'

[Chorus]

This might not sound right, but it's alright, it's real

I'm finding my way on the highway this year

[Outro]

Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

# False Starts 

[Verse 1]

Fast car, fast heart, trouble in my brain

Big dreams, false starts and I know I've changed

Don't want the things we can't have

Watchin' my life just roll past

Old rooms, new paint, still it looks the same

Sad thoughts, bad luck, with no one to blame

They say the trouble don't last

Sometimes the pain makes me laugh, oh, oh

[Pre-Chorus]

It's hard, but it only gets harder

Tonight we can go it alone

[Chorus]

Ooh, no one ever has to know

No one ever has to know

Ooh, no one ever has to know

But I know I have to go

Yeah, I'm shakin', my heart's naked

Out of control, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh

[Verse 2]

There's no morе time, gotta get my way

What do you want? We don't havе to stay

Trust me you're not gonna crash

They say that trouble don't last

[Pre-Chorus]

It's hard, but it only gets harder

Tonight we can go it alone

[Chorus]

Ooh, no one ever has to know

No one ever has to know

Ooh, no one ever has to know

But I know I have to go

Yeah, I'm shakin', my heart's naked

Out of control, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh

[Bridge]

Before I leave a part of me behind

Before I leave a part of me behind

# The Time 

[Verse 1]

Yesterday just came and went

And if today I wake up late, I won't forgive myself

’Cause time's running its own game

And I've rolled the dice too many times in my head

[Pre-Chorus]

Never fell for the fame thing

They fell in love with the same things

Let me know when the rain ends

See all I need is you

[Chorus]

Ain’t it special? Ain't it precious?

The time that we have

When I'm laid in your bed and you tell me you lovе me

[Verse 2]

Colours back in all my days

Build the structure, lеt it break

As long as it's good for your brain

Lessons learned is what I've gained

Feedin' families, forget the fame

I'm doing it now for a second name

[Pre-Chorus]

Never fell for the fame thing

They fell in love with the same things

Let me know when the rain ends

See all I need is you

[Chorus]

Ain't it special? Ain’t it precious?

The time that we have

When I’m laid in your bed and you tell me you love me

[Bridge]

And I could cry when you tell me that you love me

When you're doing things you shouldn’t be

And I lie for you

And I could cry when you tell me that you love me

And I'd die for you if you asked me to

[Chorus]

Ain't it special? Ain't it precious?

The time that we have

When I’m laid in your bed and you tell me you love me

[Outro]

And when you tell me you love me

When you tell me you love me

When you tell me you love me

When you tell me you love me

# Something In The Water 

[Chorus]

Must be somethin' in the water

I can feel you in the atmosphere

Don't say much until we speak in tongues

One on one

Swear you flowin' through my blood

Must be somethin' in the water

[Verse 1]

Am I goin' out my mind?

Said it was the last, last two or three times

Spent the whole day till we woke up last night

Nothing's makin' sense no more

Caught a glimpse of you gaze, I was frozen

Got a grip on my heart, now it's stolen

Had a lock on the door, now it's open, now oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]

Must be somethin' in the water

I can feel you in the atmosphere

Don't say much until we spеak in tongues

One on one

Swеar you flowin' through my blood

Must be somethin' in the water

On the edge until you pull me in

Got me drippin' in that old school love

Pour me some, feelings got me goin' numb

[Post-Chorus]

Must be somethin' in the water, in the water

Must be somethin' in the water, in the water

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

(Water)

[Verse 2]

I might let myself sink

Deep into the bottom, can't hear myself think

'Cause all I wanna hear is your voice

Pull me out of that void

It's an instinct, I don't have a choice tonight

You got my heart doin' things it don't do

But I'm not gon' fight it

You’re in control, just show me what to do

I'm not afraid

[Chorus]

Must be somethin' in the water

I can feel you in the atmosphere

Don't say much until we speak in tongues

One on one

Swear you flowin' through my blood

Must be somethin' in the water

On the edge until you pull me in

Got me drippin' in that old school love

Pour me some, feelings got me goin' numb

[Post-Chorus]

Must be somethin' in the water, in the water

Must be somethin' in the water, in the water

# Shoot At Will 

[Chorus]

Just took a drag, oh, ain't it a drag?

When you feel like history's pullin' you back

Yeah, I've been runnin' bare feet in a field

Yeah, a dream gon' bad

'Cause it feels like history's pullin' me back

[Verse 1]

I stayed at the ball and had a good time

'Cause I had some bullshit up on my mind

Roll with the tide

When I look at her, all I see is you

When you look at her, do you see me too?

[Bridge]

Does it not occur to you?

Do you not prefer the truth?

I was in love with you

Though I didn't show the proof

[Chorus]

Just took a drag, oh, ain't it a drag?

When you feel like history's pullin' you back

Yeah, I've been runnin' bare feet in a field

Yeah, a dream gon' bad

'Cause it feels like history's pullin' me back

'Cause it feels like history's pullin' me back

[Verse 2]

I hold my hands up for the firing squad

And if you want, you can take it all

I don't really know, I can't give no more

Shoot at will

Because she shoots to kill, yeah

And I'm dyin' inside

# Fuchsia Sea 

[Intro]

I'm tired of the grey

I'm sick of the pain

I'm tired of the pain

I'm sick of the grey

[Verse 1]

I gotta love this feelin'

To keep myself from dreamin' about somethin' else

And you keep me entertained 'cause I saw the flame, and you still walked through it

[Pre-Chorus]

I bet you knew it, that I would do it if I'm given the chance

[Chorus]

Ferocious devotion

I can't keep it up, I'm fallin' into motion

Ferocious devotion

I can't keep it up, I'm fallin' into motion

[Verse 2]

Just let me fall into motion

How can you break when you're broken to begin with?

I can't see it with you, I can't live with you

Don't you hear me when I'm talkin'?

[Pre-Chorus]

I bet you knew it, that I would do it if I'm given the chance

[Chorus]

Ferocious devotion

I can't keep it up, I'm fallin' into motion

Ferocious devotion

I can't keep it up, I'm fallin' into motion

[Bridge]

Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah

Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah

[Outro]

I'm tired of the grey

I'm sick of the pain

I'm tired of the pain

I'm sick of the grey
