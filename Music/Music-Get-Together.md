# BABY SAID - Måneskin

[Verse 1]

What's your thoughts about religion?

Are you close to your mother?

Tell me 'bout your dream vacation

And all of your ex lovers

[Pre-Chorus]

Tell me now, what's that look on your face?

She puts her hand on my lips

Begging, "Please end this conversation"

[Chorus]

Baby said, "When you're talkin' I go dead

Shut your mouth, give me your head"

Uh-uh, uh, uh, know you really want to

Baby said, "Let me taste your silhouette

You can talk between my legs"

Uh-uh, uh, uh, know you really want to

[Verse 2]

Tell me what's your favorite color

And all of your ambitions

I'm not afraid of you being vulgar

But why are you so vicious?

[Pre-Chorus]

Tell me now, what's that look on your face?

She puts her hand on my lips

Begging, "Please end this conversation"

[Chorus]

Baby said, "When you're talkin' I go dead

Shut your mouth, give me your head"

Uh-uh, uh, uh, know you really want to

Baby said, "Let me taste your silhouette

You can talk between my legs"

Uh-uh, uh, uh, know you really want to

[Bridge]

I was runnin' and runnin' and runnin' and runnin' and runnin' after you

I was runnin' and runnin' and runnin' and runnin' and runnin' after you

I was cryin' and lovin' while you were just cummin' and howlin' at the moon

Yeah, you were runnin' and runnin' and runnin' away from this conversation

[Chorus]

Baby said, "When you're talkin' I go dead

Shut your mouth, give me your head"

Uh-uh, uh, uh, know you really want to

Baby said, "Let me taste your silhouette

You can talk between my legs"

Uh-uh, uh, uh, know you really want to (Go!)

[Outro]

I wish she didn't, but my baby said

I wish she didn't, but my baby said

I wish she didn't, but my baby said

I wish she didn't, but my baby said

# 505 - Arctic Monkeys

[Chorus]

I'm going back to 505

If it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive

In my imagination, you're waitin' lyin' on your side

With your hands between your thighs

[Verse]

Stop and wait a sec

And when you look at me like that, my darlin'

What did you expect?

I'd probably still adore you

With your hands around my neck

Or I did last time I checked

Not shy of a spark

The knife twists at the thought

That I should fall short of the mark

Frightened by the bite, though

It's no harsher than the bark

The middle of adventure

Such a perfect place to start

[Chorus]

I'm going back to 505

If it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive

In my imagination, you're waitin' lyin' on your side

With your hands between your thighs

[Bridge]

But I crumble completely when you cry

It seems like once again you've had to greet me with goodbye

I'm always just about to go and spoil the surprise

Take my hands off of your eyes too soon

[Chorus]

I'm going back to 505

If it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive

In my imagination, you're waitin' lyin' on your side

With your hands between your thighs and a smile

# GOSSIP - Måneskin

[Verse 1]

Welcome to the city of lies where everything's got a price

Gonna be in your favorite place

You can be a movie star and get everything you want

Just put some plastic on your face

[Pre-Chorus]

This place is a circus, you just see the surface

They cover shit under the rug

You can't see they're fakin', they'll never be naked

Just fill your drink with tonic gin, this is the American dream, so

[Chorus]

Sip the gossip, drink 'til you choke

Sip the gossip, burn down your throat

You're not iconic, you are just like them all

Don't act like you don't know, so

Sip the gossip, drink 'til you choke

Sip the gossip, burn down your throat

You're not iconic, you are just like them all

Don't act like you don't know, oh

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]

Keep drinkin' and acting cool, don't care if your day is blue

Nobody loves a gloomy face, just

Take your pills and dance all night, don't think at all, that's the advice

So c'mon, let's try, it's just a taste

[Pre-Chorus]

This place is a circus, you just see the surface

They cover shit under the rug

You can't see they're fakin', they'll never be naked

Just fill your drink with tonic gin, this is the American dream, so

[Chorus]

Sip the gossip, drink 'til you choke

Sip the gossip, burn down your throat

You're not iconic, you are just like them all

Don't act like you don't know, so

Sip the gossip, drink 'til you choke

Sip the gossip, burn down your throat

You're not iconic, you are just like them all

Don't act like you don't know, oh

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]

So sip the gossip, drink 'til you choke

Sip the gossip, burn down your throat

You're not iconic, you are just like them all

Don't act like you don't know, oh

# TIMEZONE - Måneskin

[Verse 1]

You're wearing my old clothes, but you, you wear it better

And every time I see your face, the moon should be jealous

And I keep talking to the wall 'til he's a friend of mine

I call you every hour just to tell you that I'm losing my mind

[Pre-Chorus]

Now I know you're sleepin' where I'm supposed to be, and

Wish I could've stayed

[Chorus]

Only thing that keeps us apart

Is seven thousand miles, running like a mad dog

Only thing that keeps us apart

Is a different timezone

So fuck what I'm dreaming, this fame has no meaning

I'm coming home

Only thing that keeps us apart

Is a different timezone

[Verse 2]

Tomorrow I've got another plane, I'm not gonna take it

Mmh, instead I'm gonna fly straight to you, I paid double for the tickets

And I don't give a shit about the contracts that I signed

And they can say whatever, we'll be making love, I'm fucking you tonight

[Pre-Chorus]

Now I know you're sleeping where I'm supposed to be, and

Wish I could've stayed

[Chorus]

Only thing that keeps us apart

Is seven thousand miles, running like a mad dog

Only thing that keeps us apart

Is a different timezone

So fuck what I'm dreaming, this fame has no meaning

I'm coming home

Only thing that keeps us apart

Is a different timezone

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]

So fuck what I'm dreaming, this fame has no meaning

I'm coming home

The only thing that keeps us apart

Is a different timezone

# Ballena - Vulgo FK, Mc ph, Veigh

[Chorus: Vulgo FK]

Two doses from the pink drink

High heels, Prada Milano, she's all sensual

I wonder if she's from the job, she was at France

Drinking on a beach in Dubai

And I want to know what you're hiding underneath all this attitude

I want to see you naked

And awaken your naughty side

Make you wet, but not embarassed

[First Verse: MC PH]

Baby, if you wanna fuck

You have to follow my lead

'Cause my life is on a hurry and I can't wait for you

Show up at the Goma before I travel

'Cause I don't know when I'll be back

Nor if I will want to bump into you again

Let go of this phone and play with me

On my bed she does beautiful things

With two of her girlfriends, it's unbeliеvable

And she always invites my favoritе ones

There's weed and liquor, I know what you need

[Chorus: Vulgo FK]

Two doses from the pink drink

High heels, Prada Milano, she's all sensual

I wonder if she's from the job, she was at France

Drinking on a beach in Dubai

And I want to know what you're hiding underneath all this attitude

I want to see you naked

And awaken your naughty side

Make you wet, but not embarassed

[Second Verse: Veigh]

So hot

The clothes she wears at home, they're better than yours (Uh-uh-yeah) when there's Baile

While one fucks with a smile on her face, the other is crying

There's phases and phases

I-I get this girl when I lose my shame

I'm shy, but I'm light on my feet

A calm boy, that doesn't drinks nor smokes

But loves to shag all the time

Ca-cash is the fetish of the thug

She goes up and down with the hand on her hair

And the ending of the night is at home, w-w-with her throwing back at me

Throwing, throwing (ye-yeah), throwing, throwing, throwing

They're all actresses, and she's throwing back at me

Some earn with this

Some never star in the movie

And the ending is always sad

[Chorus: Vulgo FK]

Two doses from the pink drink

High heels, Prada Milano, she's all sensual

I wonder if she's from the job, she was at France

Drinking on a beach in Dubai

And I want to know what you're hiding underneath all this attitude

I want to see you naked

And awaken your naughty side

Make you wet, but not embarassed

Suite 506 foi ela quem fez a escolha

Na cama redonda deixei ela muito doida

Foi só tapão na bunda

Só socadão com força

Joguei balinha na língua

Aí, como é que pode

Na frente do espelho

Ela com o pirulito pop

Aí ela fode, fode

Essa mina fode

I am so much fun without Hennessy

They just want my love and my energy

You can't talk no shit without penalties

Bitch, I’m in yo’ shit if you send for me

I'm going to glow up one more time

Trust me, I have magical foresight

You gon’ see me sleepin' in courtside

You gon' see me eatin' ten more times

Ugh, you can’t take that bitch nowhere

Ugh, I look better with no hair

Ugh, ain't no sign I can't smoke here

Ugh, gimme the chance and I'll go there (Yeah)

[Chorus: Doja Cat]

Yeah, bitch, I said what I said

I'd rather be famous instead

I let all that get to my head

I don't care, I paint the town red

Bitch, I said what I said

I'd rather be famous instead

I let all that get to my head

I don't care, I paint the town red

[Post-Chorus: Doja Cat]

Mm, she the devil

She a bad lil' bitch, she a rebel

She put her foot to the pedal

It'll take a whole lot for me to settle

Mm, she the devil

She a bad lil' bitch, she a rebel

She put her foot to the pedal

It'll take a whole lot for me to settle (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Doja Cat]

Said pop make money, now you try, bitch

You could use a revamp with a new vibe, sis

I don't need a big feature or a new sidekick

I don't need a new fan 'cause my boo like it

I don't need to wear a wig to make you like it

I'm a two-time bitch, you ain't knew I'd win?

Throw a shot like you tryna have a food fight then

All my opps waitin' for me to be you, I bet

Said I got drive, I don't need a car

Money really all that we fiendin' for

I'm doin' things they ain't seen before

Fans ain't dumb, but extremists are

I'm a demon lord

Fall off what? I ain't seen the horse

Called your bluff, better cite the source

Fame ain't somethin' that I need no more

[Chorus: Doja Cat]

'Cause, bitch, I said what I said

I'd rather be famous instead

I let all that get to my head

I don't care, I paint the town red

Bitch, I said what I said

I'd rather be famous instead

I let all that get to my head

I don't care, I paint the town red

[Post-Chorus: Doja Cat]

Mm, she the devil

She a bad lil' bitch, she a rebel

She put her foot to the pedal

It'll take a whole lot for me to settle

Mm, she the devil

She a bad lil' bitch, she a rebel

She put her foot to the pedal

It'll take a whole lot for me to settle

# all the things she said - t.a.t.u

[Chorus: Julia & Lena]

All the things she said, all the things she said

Runnin' through my head, runnin' through my head

Runnin' through my head

All the things she said, all the things she said

Runnin' through my head, runnin' through my head

All the things she said (All the things she said)

This is not enough (Enough, enough, enough)

[Verse 1: Julia, Lena]

I'm in serious shit, I feel totally lost

If I'm asking for help, it's only because

Being with you has opened my eyes

Could I ever believe such a perfect surprise?

I keep asking myself, wondering how

I keep closing my eyes, but I can't block you out

Wanna fly to a place where it's just you and me

Nobody else, so we can be free

(Nobody else, so we can be free)

[Chorus: Julia & Lena, Julia]

All the things she said, all the things she said

Runnin' through my head, runnin' through my head

Runnin' through my head

All the things she said, all the things she said

All the things she said, all the things she said

All the things she said

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2: Julia, Lena]

And I'm all mixed up, feeling cornered and rushed

They say it's my fault, but I want her so much

Wanna fly her away where the sun and rain

Come in over my face, wash away all the shame

When they stop and stare, don't worry me

'Cause I'm feeling for her what she's feeling for me

I can try to pretend, I can try to forget

But it's driving me mad, going out of my head

[Chorus: Julia & Lena, Lena]

All the things she said, all the things she said

Runnin' through my head, runnin' through my head

Runnin' through my head

All the things she said, all the things she said

Runnin' through my head, runnin' through my head

All the things she said (All the things she said)

Mother lookin' at me

Tell me, "What do you see?"

Yes, I've lost my mind

Daddy lookin' at me

Will I ever be free?

Have I crossed the line?

All the things she said, all the things she said

Runnin' through my head, runnin' through my head

# Sorry - Nothing But Thieves

[Verse 1]

You might kill me with desire

Wind me tighter than a wire

It's something that you do to me

I run away like mercury

And I know you think it's rough

When you're tryna patch us up

And I say, "Honey, what is love?"

You just say I drink too much

[Chorus]

Maybe I'm defective

Or maybe I'm dumb

I'm sorry, so sorry for what I've done

Maybe I'm bad natured

Or maybe I'm young

I'm sorry, so sorry for what I've done

[Verse 2]

And on the t-shirt that I wear

Pick the thorns out of my hair

I broke your heart so carelessly

But made the pieces part of me

And now it hurts what we've become

'Cause you taught me how to love

It's me who taught you how to stop

And you just say I drink too much

[Chorus]

Maybe I'm defective

Or maybe I'm dumb

I'm sorry, so sorry for what I've done

Maybe I'm bad natured

Or maybe I'm young

I'm sorry, so sorry for what I've done

[Bridge]

I've waited for this

I'm ready for it

I've waited for this

I'm ready for it

I've been waiting so long

I've waited for this

I'm ready for it

I've waited for this

I'm ready for it

I've been waiting so long

[Chorus]

Maybe I'm defective

Or maybe I'm dumb

I'm sorry, so sorry for what I've done

Maybe I'm bad natured

Or maybe I'm young

I'm sorry, so sorry for what I've done

# There Was Sun - Nothing But Thieves

[Verse 1]

There was sun

Shone down upon me

Felt so warm on me

Golden leaves hanging on the trees

So much sun

The summer shimmer

I saw a glimmer

I could be who I wanna be

[Pre-Chorus]

I could dream that, I could dream that

I could dream that, I could dream that

I could dream that, I could dream that

I could dream that, I could dream that

[Chorus]

Oh, I wish I could dream that I could dream like I used to dream

Oh, I wish I could be all the things that I used to be

Oh, I wish I could dream that I could dream like I used to dream

Oh, I wish I could be all the things that I used to be

[Verse 2]

Thеre was sun

Indica head rush

Bursting upon us

All my flaws layin' on the ground

In thе sun

I'm not a stranger

Black-hearted angel

Oh, I hate when you're not around

[Pre-Chorus]

Some days I feel somewhere else or somewhere in between

Some days I don't feel a thing at all

Now, I'm pulling back the screen to let the future in

The light comes flooding in

The light comes flooding in

[Chorus]

Oh, I wish I could dream that I could dream like I used to dream

Oh, I wish I could be all the things that I used to be

Oh, I wish I could dream that I could dream like I used to dream

Oh, I wish I could be all the things that I used to be

[Post-Chorus]

When there was sun

When there was sun

When there was sun

There was sun

[Pre-Chorus]

Some days I feel somewhere else or somewhere in between

Some days I don't feel a thing at all

Now, I'm pulling back the screen to let the future in

The light comes flooding in

The light comes flooding in

[Chorus]

Oh, I wish I could dream that I could dream like I used to dream

Oh, I wish I could be all the things that I used to be

Oh, I wish I could dream that I could dream like I used to dream

Oh, I wish I could be all the things that I used to be

[Post-Chorus]

When there was sun

When there was sun

When there was sun

There was sun

Drive me so (So, so) crazy, did you know you got that effect?"

I said, "Lemme check, yeah"

I would want myself

Just to know me, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]

I think I talk too much

I need to listen, baby

I need to listen, baby

I need to listen good

I think I try too hard

How I look, what I do, what I'm sayin'

I spend too much time explainin' myself

I hope there's some time to change it

I can taste it, my heart's breakin', please don't say

That you know, when you know

I can't take it, I'm impatient, tell me, baby

Now I know, you should go

But it goes away for a minute when I'm with you, breathing

Jesus is my virtue

And Judas is the demon I cling to

# I kissed a girl - Katy Perry

[Verse 1]

This was never the way I planned

Not my intention

I got so brave, drink in hand

Lost my discretion

It's not what I'm used to

Just wanna try you on

I'm curious for you

Caught my attention

[Chorus]

I kissed a girl and I liked it

The taste of her cherry ChapStick

I kissed a girl just to try it

I hope my boyfriend don't mind it

It felt so wrong, it felt so right

Don't mean I'm in love tonight

I kissed a girl and I liked it

I liked it

[Verse 2]

No, I don't even know your name

It doesn't matter

You're my experimental game

Just human nature

It's not what good girls do

Not how they should behave

My head gets so confused

Hard to obey

[Chorus]

I kissed a girl and I liked it

The taste of her cherry ChapStick

I kissed a girl just to try it

I hope my boyfriend don't mind it

It felt so wrong, it felt so right

Don't mean I'm in love tonight

I kissed a girl and I liked it

I liked it

[Bridge]

Us girls, we are so magical

Soft skin, red lips, so kissable

Hard to resist, so touchable

Too good to deny it

Ain't no big deal, it's innocent

[Chorus]

I kissed a girl and I liked it

The taste of her cherry ChapStick

I kissed a girl just to try it

I hope my boyfriend don't mind it

It felt so wrong, it felt so right

Don't mean I'm in love tonight

I kissed a girl and I liked it

I liked it

Music to my heart, that's what you are (Ba-ba-baby)

A song that goes on and on (And on)

I, I love you like a love song, baby (I love you)

# why’d you only call me when you’re high - arctic monkeys

[Verse 1]

The mirror's image tells me it's home time

But I'm not finished, 'cause you're not by my side

And as I arrived I thought I saw you leavin'

Carryin' your shoes

Decided that once again I was just dreamin'

Of bumpin' into you

[Chorus]

Now, it's three in the mornin'

And I'm tryna' change your mind

Left you multiple missed calls

And to my message, you reply

"Why'd you only call me when you're high?"

"Hi, why'd you only call me when you're high?"

[Verse 2]

Somewhere darker, talkin' the same shite

I need a partner, (High) well are you out tonight?

It's harder and harder to get you to listen

More I get through the gears

Incapable of makin' alright decisions

And having bad ideas

[Chorus]

Now, it's three in the mornin'

And I'm tryna' change your mind

Left you multiple missed calls

And to my message, you reply (Message, you reply)

"Why'd you only call me when you're high?"

(Why'd you only call me when you're)

"Hi, why'd you only call me when you're high?"

[Bridge]

And I can't see you here, wonder where I might

It sort of feels like I'm runnin' out of time

I haven't found all I was hopin' to find

You said you got to be up in the mornin'

Gonna have an early night

And you're startin' to bore me, baby

"Why'd you only call me when you're high?"

[Outro]

"Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?"

"Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?"

"Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?"

"Why'd you only ever phone me when you're (high)?"

# set fire to the rain - adele

[Verse 1]

I let it fall, my heart

And as it fell, you rose to claim it

It was dark, and I was over

Until you kissed my lips and you saved me

My hands, they were strong

But my knees were far too weak

To stand in your arms

Without falling to your feet

[Pre-Chorus]

But there's a side to you

That I never knew, never knew

All the things you'd say

They were never true, never true

And the games you'd play

You would always win, always win

[Chorus]

But I set fire to the rain

Watched it pour as I touched your face

Well, it burned while I cried

'Cause I heard it screamin' out your name

Your name

[Verse 2]

When I lay with you

I could stay there, close my eyes

Feel you here forever

You and me together, nothing is better

[Pre-Chorus]

'Cause there's a side to you

That I never knew, never knew

All the things you'd say

They were never true, never true

And the games you'd play

You would always win, always win

[Chorus]

But I set fire to the rain

Watched it pour as I touched your face

Well, it burned while I cried

'Cause I heard it screamin' out your name

Your name

I set fire to the rain

And I threw us into the flames

When we fell, somethin' died

'Cause I knew that that was the last time

The last time

[Bridge]

Sometimes, I wake up by the door

That heart you caught must be waitin' for you

Even now, when we're already over

I can't help myself from lookin' for you

[Chorus]

I set fire to the rain

Watched it pour as I touched your face

Well, it burned while I cried

'Cause I heard it screamin' out your name

Your name

I set fire to the rain

And I threw us into the flames

When we fell, somethin' died

'Cause I knew that that was the last time

The last time

[Outro]

Oh

Oh, no

Let it burn

Oh

Let it burn

Let it burn

# After Dark - Mr.Kitty

[Verse 1]

I see you, you see me

How pleasant, this feeling

The moment you hold me

I missed you, I'm sorry

I've given what I have

I showed you I'm growing

The ashes fall slowly

As your voice consoles me

[Chorus]

As the hours pass, I will let you know

That I need to ask, before I'm alone

How it feels to rest on your patient lips

To eternal bliss, I'm so glad to know

As the hours pass, I will let you know

That I need to ask, before I'm alone

How it feels to rest on your patient lips

To eternal bliss, I'm so glad to know

[Verse 2]

We're swaying to drum beats

In motion, I'm feeling

My patience controlling

The question, I won't speak

We're telling the stories

Our laughter, he knows me

We're leaving, we're talking

You're closer, it's calming

[Chorus]

As the hours pass, I will let you know

That I need to ask, before I'm alone

How it feels to rest, on your patient lips

To eternal bliss, I'm so glad to know

As the hours pass, I will let you know

That I need to ask, before I'm alone

How it feels to rest on your patient lips

To eternal bliss, I'm so glad to know

[Bridge]

The night will hold us close, and the stars will guide us home

I've been waiting for this moment, we're finally alone

I turn to ask the question, so anxious, my thoughts

Your lips were soft like winter, in your passion, I was lost

[Chorus]

As the hours pass, I will let you know

That I need to ask, before I'm alone

How it feels to rest on your patient lips

To eternal bliss, I'm so glad to know

As the hours pass, I will let you know

That I need to ask, before I'm alone

How it feels to rest on your patient lips

To eternal bliss, I'm so glad to know

As the hours pass, I will let you know

That I need to ask, before I'm alone

How it feels to rest on your patient lips

To eternal bliss, I'm so glad to know

As the hours pass, I will let you know

That I need to ask, before I'm alone

How it feels to rest on your patient lips

To eternal bliss, I'm so glad to know

# somebody that i used to know - gotye

[Verse 1: Gotye]

Now and then, I think of when we were together

Like when you said you felt so happy, you could die

I told myself that you were right for me

But felt so lonely in your company

But that was love and it's an ache I still remember

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2: Gotye]

You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness

Like resignation to the end, always the end

So when we found that we could not make sense

Well, you said that we would still be friends

But I'll admit that I was glad it was over

[Chorus: Gotye]

But you didn't have to cut me off

Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing

And I don't even need your love

But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough

No, you didn't have to stoop so low

Have your friends collect your records and then change your number

I guess that I don't need that, though

Now you're just somebody that I used to know

[Post-Chorus: Gotye]

Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Now you're just somebody that I used to know

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3: Kimbra]

Now and then, I think of all the times you screwed me over

But had me believing it was always something that I'd done

But I don't wanna live that way

Reading into every word you say

You said that you could let it go

And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know

[Chorus: Gotye]

But you didn't have to cut me off

Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing (Ah)

And I don't even need your love (Ohh)

But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough (Ah)

No, you didn't have to stoop so low (Ohh)

Have your friends collect your records and then change your number (Ah)

I guess that I don't need that, though (Ohh)

Now you're just somebody that I used to know

[Outro: Gotye, Gotye & Kimbra]

Somebody (I used to know)

Somebody (Now you're just somebody that I used to know)

Somebody (I used to know)

Somebody (Now you're just somebody that I used to know)

(I used to know)

(That I used to know)

(I used to know)

# video games - lana del rey

[Verse 1]

Swingin' in the backyard, pull up in your fast car

Whistlin' my name

Open up a beer and you say, "Get over here

And play a video game"

I'm in his favorite sundress, watching me get undressed

Take that body downtown

I say, "You the bestest," lean in for a big kiss, put his favorite perfume on

"Go play your video game"

[Chorus]

It's you, it's you, it's all for you, everything I do

I tell you all the time, Heaven is a place on Earth with you

Tell me all the things you wanna do

I heard that you like the bad girls, honey, is that true?

It's better than I ever even knew

They say that the world was built for two

Only worth living if somebody is loving you

And, baby, now you do

[Post-Chorus]

Mmm

[Verse 2]

Singin' in the old bars, swinging with the old stars

Livin' for the fame

Kissin' in the blue dark, playing pool and wild darts

Video games

He holds me in his big arms, drunk, and I am seeing stars

This is all I think of

Watchin' all our friends fall in and out of Old Paul's, this is my idea of fun

Playin' video games

[Chorus]

It's you, it's you, it's all for you, everything I do

I tell you all the time, Heaven is a place on Earth with you

Tell me all the things you wanna do

I heard that you like the bad girls, honey, is that true?

It's better than I ever even knew

They say that the world was built for two

Only worth living if somebody is loving you

And, baby, now you do

[Post-Chorus]

(N-now you do, now you do, now you do)

(N-now you do, now you do, now you do)

[Chorus]

It's you, it's you, it's all for you, everything I do

I tell you all the time, Heaven is a place on Earth with you

Tell me all the things you wanna do

I heard that you like the bad girls, honey, is that true?

It's better than I ever even knew

They say that the world was built for two

Only worth living if somebody is loving you

And, baby, now you do

[Post-Chorus]

(N-now you do, now you do, now you do)

Mmm, now you do

# say so - doja cat

[Chorus]

Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment

I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?

Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with

You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so

Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment

I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?

Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with

You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so

[Verse 1]

It's been a long time since you fell in love

You ain't coming out your shell, you ain't really been yourself

Tell me, what must I do? (Do tell, my love)

'Cause luckily, I'm good at reading

I wouldn't bug him, but he won't stop cheesin'

And we can dance all day around it

If you frontin', I'll be bouncing

If you want it, scream it, shout it, babe

Before I leave you dry

[Chorus]

Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment

I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?

Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with

You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so

I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?

Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with

You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so (Yeah)

[Verse 2]

Let me check my chest, my breath right quick (Ha)

He ain't ever seen it in a dress like this (Ah)

He ain't ever even been impressed like this

Prolly why I got him quiet on the set like zip

Like it, love it, need it bad

Take it, own it, steal it fast

Boy, stop playing, grab my ass

Why you actin' like you shy? (Hot)

Shut it, save it, keep it pushin'

Why you beating 'round the bush?

Knowin' you want all this woman

All of my niggas sayin' you mad committed

Realer than anybody you had, and pretty

All of the body-ody, the ass and titties

# Somebody Else - The 1975

[Verse 1]

So I heard you found somebody else

And at first, I thought it was a lie

I took all my things that make sounds

The rest I can do without

[Chorus]

I don't want your body

But I hate to think about you with somebody else

Our love has gone cold

You're intertwining your soul with somebody else

I'm looking through you

While you're looking through your phone

And then leaving with somebody else

No, I don't want your body

But I'm picturing your body with somebody else (Else, else...)

[Post-Chorus]

I don't want your body, I don't want your body

I don't want your body, I don't want your body

I don't want your body, I don't want your body

I don't want your body, I don't want your body

[Verse 2]

And c'mon baby (I know)

This ain't the last time that I'll see your face

And c'mon baby (I know)

You said you'd find someone to take my place (Place, place)

I just don't believe that you have got it in you

'Cause we are just gonna keep “Doin' it” and every time

I start to believe in anything you're saying

I'm reminded that I should be gettin' over it

[Chorus]

I don't want your body

But I hate to think about you with somebody else

Our love has gone cold

You're intertwining your soul with somebody else

I'm looking through you

While you're looking through your phone

And then leaving with somebody else

No, I don't want your body

But I'm picturing your body with somebody else (Else, else...)

[Post-Chorus]

I don't want your body, I don't want your body

I don't want your body, I don't want your body

I don't want your body, I don't want your body

I don't want your body, I don't want your body

# it will rain - bruno mars

[Verse 1]

If you ever leave me, baby

Leave some morphine at my door

'Cause it would take a whole lot of medication

To realize what we used to have

We don't have it anymore

There's no religion that could save me

No matter how long my knees are on the floor, oh

So keep in mind all the sacrifices I'm makin'

To keep you by my side

To keep you from walkin' out the door

[Chorus]

'Cause there'll be no sunlight, if I lose you, baby

There'll be no clear skies, if I lose you, baby

Just like the clouds, my eyes will do the same

If you walk away, every day, it'll rain, rain, rain

[Verse 2]

I'll never be your mother's favorite

Your daddy can't even look me in the eye

Ooh, if I was in their shoes, I'd be doin' the same thing

Sayin', "There goes my little girl

Walkin' with that troublesome guy"

But they're just afraid of somethin' they can't understand

Ooh, but, little darlin', watch me change their minds

Yeah, for you, I'll try, I'll try, I'll try, I'll try

[Refrain]

And pick up these broken pieces 'til I'm bleedin'

If that'll make you mine

[Chorus]

'Cause there'll be no sunlight, if I lose you, baby

There'll be no clear skies, if I lose you, baby

Just like the clouds, my eyes will do the same

If you walk away, every day it'll rain, rain, rain

[Bridge]

Oh, don't you say (Don't you say) goodbye (Goodbye)

Don't you say (Don't you say) goodbye (Goodbye)

[Refrain]

I'll pick up these broken pieces 'til I'm bleedin'

If that'll make it right

[Chorus]

'Cause there'll be no sunlight, if I lose you, baby

There'll be no clear skies, if I lose you, baby

Just like the clouds, my eyes will do the same

If you walk away, every day it'll rain, rain, rain

# Te Amo - Rihanna

[Verse 1]

"Te amo, te amo", she says to me

I hear the pain in her voice

Then, we danced underneath the candelabra

She takes the lead

That's when I saw it in her eyes, it's over

[Chorus]

Then, she said, "Te amo"

Then, she put her hand around me waist

I told her no, she cried, "Te amo"

I told her, "I'm not gonna run away, but let me go"

My soul is awry without askin' why

I said, "Te amo," wish somebody'd tell me what she said

Don't it mean "I love you"?

Think it means "I love you"

Don't it mean "I love you"?

[Verse 2]

"Te amo, te amo," she's scared to breathe

I hold her hand, I got no choice, uh

Pulled me out on the beach, danced in the water

I start to leave

She's begging me and askin', "Why it's over?"

Then, she said, "Te amo"

Then, she put her hand around me waist

# The Color Violet - Joongle

[Verse 1]

I took my drugs and took my lovin' when I left out the spot

I left the party with a Barbie, marking X on the dot

She calls my phone up, but I told her, "I'm a loner" (Uh)

But she likes my watch and my droptop and my persona (Uh)

We hit the highway, one-five-five with my whole foot on the dash

She's in my ear, she's got no fear, she could care less if we crash

[Pre-Chorus]

But on my radar, I've got some nerve to play hard

I waited for my chance, but playboys, we don't dance, dance, dance

[Chorus]

I lost my heart (Uh)

Speedin' car, goin' ninety in the rain

Shе took my heart, filled it with nothin' but pain

This beat in my dancе is not for romance

I wanna stay, but playboys, we don't dance, dance, dance (I)

So I won't dance again (I), oh, baby

No, I won't dance again (That's why), oh yeah (Uh)

No, I won't dance again (I)

No, I won't dance again

Pretty baby, ooh

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]

Uh

Face in the daylight, wastin' time on the stars in the sky

She's got my pager, blankets of love fall on my eyes

Then I'm reminded, love don't come 'til you find it

I just hope that it's workin', I'm yearnin', I'm searchin', uh

The afterparty was on Wilson and 73rd

You got the notion that somebody else was with me first

[Pre-Chorus]

But on my radar, you had some nerve to play hard

You took away my chance, but playboys, we don't dance, dance, dance

[Chorus]

I lost my heart (Uh)

Speedin' car goin' ninety in the rain

She took my heart, filled it with nothin' but pain

This beat in my dance is not for romance

I wanna stay, but playboys, we don't dance, dance, dance (I)

At the Body Shop

Doin' something unholy

He's sat back while she's droppin' it

She be poppin' it

Yeah, she put it down slowly

Oh-ee-oh-ee-oh, he left his kids at

Ho-ee-oh-ee-ome so he can get that

Mummy don't know Daddy's getting hot

At the Body Shop

Doin' something unholy (Woo)

[Verse 2: Kim Petras]

Mm, daddy, daddy, if you want it, drop the addy (Yeah, yeah)

Give me love, give me Fendi, my Balenciaga daddy

You gon' need to bag it up 'cause I'm spendin' on Rodeo (Woo)

You can watch me back it up, I'll be gone in the A.M. (Yeah)

And he, he get me Prada, get me Miu Miu like Rihanna (Ah)

He always call me 'cause I never cause no drama (Drama)

And when you want it, baby, I know I got you covered (Yeah, yeah)

And when you need it, baby, just jump under the covers (Yeah)

[Chorus: Sam Smith, Kim Petras, Both]

Mummy don't know Daddy's getting hot (Hot)

At the Body Shop (Shop)

Doin' something unholy

He's sat back while she's droppin' it (She)

She be poppin' it (She)

Yeah, she put it down slowly

Oh-ee-oh-ee-oh, he left his kids at

Ho-ee-oh-ee-ome so he can get that

Mummy don't know Daddy's getting hot (Unholy)

At the Body Shop (Ah)

Doin' something unholy (Unholy)

[Outro: Sam Smith & Kim Petras]

# i'm yours - Isabel LaRosa

[Intro]

(Baby, I'm yours, yours, yours)

(Baby, I’m yours, yours, yours)

[Verse 1]

I know that you love me

Darling, you don't have to say it

You know you can trust me

It's okay, it’s complicated

[Pre-Chorus]

Nervous, trip over my words

You're so pretty it hurts

[Chorus]

Baby, I'm yours

Baby, I'm yours

Baby, I'm yours

I need something more

I'll pray to the Lord

That, baby, I'm yours

[Verse 2]

Is it too late to see you?

I love the view of your headlights

Wanna get to know you (Know you)

Park outside my house for the night

[Pre-Chorus]

Nervous, trip over my words

You're so pretty it hurts

[Chorus]

Baby, I’m yours

Baby, I’m yours

Baby, I'm yours

I need something more

I’ll pray to the Lord

That, baby, I'm yours

[Bridge]

We're gettin' closer, inches away

Lose composure, favorite mistake

Friendship’s over, won't be the same

(Baby, I'm yours, yours, yours)

(Baby, I'm yours, yours, yours)

(I need something more, more, more)

(But, baby, I'm yours)

[Chorus]

Baby, I'm yours

Baby, I'm yours

Baby, I'm yours

I need something more

I'll pray to the Lord

That, baby, I'm yours

# Friends - Chase Atlantic

[Verse 1: Mitchel Cave]

Girl, tell me what you're doing on the other side

And so, just tell me what you're doing with that other guy

'Cause I ain't got patience to slow down the bass

All your girlfriends are wasted

They need it, they chase it

Face it, you want it, you crave it

Believe when I say that you'll know once you taste it

[Chorus: Mitchel Cave]

All of your friends have been here for too long

They must be waiting for you to move on (Woo)

Girl, I'm not with it, I'm way too far gone

I'm not ready, eyes heavy now (Woo)

Heart on your sleeve like you've never been loved

Running in circles, now look what you've done (Woo)

Give you my word as you take it and run

Wish you'd let me stay, I'm ready now (Woo)

[Verse 2: Mitchel Cave & Christian Anthony]

Just give me some time and space to realize

That you were busy lying, sleeping round with other guys

And what the hell were we?

Tell me we weren't just friends

This doesn't make much sense, no

But I'm not hurt, I'm tense

'Cause I'll be fine without you, babe (Woo)

[Chorus: Mitchel Cave]

All of your friends have been here for too long

They must be waiting for you to move on (Woo)

Girl, I'm not with it, I'm way too far gone

I'm not ready, eyes heavy now

Heart on your sleeve like you've never been loved

Running in circles, now look what you've done (Woo)

Give you my word as you take it and run

Wish you'd let me stay, I'm ready now (Woo)

[Bridge: Mitchel Cave]

Wish you'd let me stay, I'm ready now

I'm not ready, eyes heavy now

(Woo)

[Chorus: Mitchel Cave]

All of your friends have been here for too long

They must be waiting for you to move on (Woo)

Girl, I'm not with it, I'm way too far gone

I'm not ready, eyes heavy now

Heart on your sleeve like you've never been loved

Running in circles, now look what you've done (Woo)

Give you my word as you take it and run

Wish you'd let me stay, I'm ready now (Woo)

[Outro: Mitchel Cave]

I'm not ready, eyes heavy now (Woo)

Wish you'd let me stay, I'm ready now

I'm not ready, eyes heavy now (Woo)

Wish you'd let me stay, I'm ready now (Woo)
